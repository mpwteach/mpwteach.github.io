None of the teechers at school have noticed that I am an intellectual. They
will be sorry when I am famouse. There is a new girl in our class. She sits
nixt to me in Geography Geography.
Time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana.
She is all right. Her name is Pandora, but she likes being called "Box".
Don't ask me why. I might fall in love with her. It's time I fell in love,
after all I am 13 3/4 years old.

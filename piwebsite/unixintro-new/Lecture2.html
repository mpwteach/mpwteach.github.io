    <h2>2.2 The UNIX Filesystem</h2>


    <div class="text">
      <p>
	The UNIX operating system is built around the
	concept of a filesystem which is used to store all of the information that
	constitutes the long-term state of the system. This state includes the
	operating system kernel itself, the executable files for the commands supported
	by the operating system, configuration information, temporary workfiles,
	user data, and various special files that are used to give controlled access
	to system hardware and operating system functions.

	Every item stored in a UNIX filesystem belongs to one
	of four types:
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li><b>Ordinary files</b></li>
	Ordinary files can contain text, data, or program information.
	Files cannot contain other files or directories. Unlike other operating
	systems, UNIX filenames are not broken into a name part and an extension
	part (although extensions are still frequently used as a means to classify
	files). Instead they can contain any keyboard character except for '/'
	and be up to 256 characters long (note however that characters such as
	*,?,# and &amp; have special meaning in most shells and should not therefore
	be used in filenames). Putting spaces in filenames also makes them difficult
	to manipulate - rather use the underscore '_'.

	<br>
	<li><b>Directories</b></li>
	Directories are containers or folders that hold files,
	and other directories.

	<br>
	<li><b>Devices</b></li>
	To provide applications with easy access to hardware
	devices, UNIX allows them to be used in much the same way as ordinary files.
	There are two types of devices in UNIX - <b>block-oriented</b> devices
	which transfer data in blocks (e.g. hard disks) and <b>character-oriented</b>
	devices that transfer data on a byte-by-byte basis (e.g. modems and dumb
	terminals).
	<br>

	<li><b>Links</b></li>
	A link is a pointer to another file. There are two types
	of links - a <b>hard link</b> to a file is indistinguishable from the file
	itself. A <b>soft link</b> (or symbolic link) provides an indirect pointer
	or shortcut to a file. A soft link is implemented as a directory file entry
	containing a pathname.
      </ol>
    </div>
    

    <h2>2.3 Typical UNIX Directory Structure</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
	The UNIX filesystem is laid out as a hierarchical
	tree structure which is anchored at a special top-level directory known
	as the root (designated by a slash '/'). Because of the tree structure,
	a directory can have many child directories, but only one parent directory.
	Fig. 2.1 illustrates this layout.
      </p>

      <center>
	<img SRC="dirtree.gif" height=383 width=573>
	<div class="caption">Fig. 2.1: Part of a typical UNIX filesystem tree</div>
      </center>
      
      <p>
	To specify a location in the directory hierarchy, we must
	specify a path through the tree. The path to a location can be defined
	by an absolute path from the root /, or as a relative path from the current
	working directory. To specify a path, each directory along the route from
	the source to the destination must be included in the path, with each directory
	in the sequence being separated by a slash. To help with the specification
	of relative paths, UNIX provides the shorthand "<tt>.</tt>" for the current
	directory and "<tt>..</tt>" for the parent directory. For example, the
	absolute path to the directory "<tt>play</tt>" is <tt>/home/will/play</tt>,
	while the relative path to this directory from "<tt>zeb</tt>" is <tt>../will/play</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
	Fig. 2.2 shows some typical directories you will find
	on UNIX systems and briefly describes their contents. Note that these although
	these subdirectories appear as part of a seamless logical filesystem, they
	do not need be present on the same hard disk device; some may even be located
	on a remote machine and accessed across a network.

      <p>
	When you log into UNIX, your current working directory
	is your user home directory. You can refer to your home directory at any
	time as "<tt>~</tt>" and the home directory of other users as "<tt>~&lt;login&gt;</tt>".
	So <tt>~will/play</tt> is another way for user <tt>jane</tt> to specify
	an absolute path to the directory
	<tt>/homes/will/play</tt>. User <tt>will</tt>
	may refer to the directory as <tt>~/play.</tt>

    <h2>2.4 Directory and File Handling Commands</h2>


    <div class="text">
      <p>
	This section describes some of the more important
	directory and file handling commands.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
	<li><b>pwd</b> (print [current] working directory)</li>

	<p><b>pwd</b> displays the full absolute path to the your
	  current location in the filesystem. So
	</p>
	<p class="terminal">
	  $ pwd<br>
	  /usr/bin
	</p>
	
	<p>implies that <b>/usr/bin</b> is the current working directory.</p>
	  

	<li><b>ls</b> (list directory)</li>

	<p>
	  <b>ls</b> lists the contents of a directory. If no
	  target directory is given, then the contents of the current working directory
	  are displayed. So, if the current working directory is <b>/</b>,
	</p>
	<p class="terminal">
	  $ ls<br>
	  bin dev home mnt share usr var
	  boot etc lib proc sbin tmp vol
	<p>
	  Actually, <b>ls</b> doesn't show you <i>all</i> the
	  entries in a directory - files and directories that begin with a dot (.)
	  are hidden (this includes the directories '.' and '..' which are always
	  present). The reason for this is that files that begin with a . usually
	  contain important configuration information and should not be changed under
	  normal circumstances. If you want to see all files, <b>ls</b> supports
	  the <b>-a</b> option:
	</p>
	<p class="terminal">$ ls -a</p>
	<p>
	  Even this listing is not that helpful - there are no hints
	  to properties such as the size, type and ownership of files, just their
	  names. To see more detailed information, use the <b>-l</b> option (long
	  listing), which can be combined with the <b>-a</b> option as follows:
	<p class="terminal">$ ls -a -l</p>
	<p>(or, equivalently,)</p>
	<p class="terminal">$ ls -al</p>

	<p>Each line of the output looks like this:</p>
	<img SRC="direntry.gif" height=128 width=667>

	<p>where:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <i>type</i> is a single character which is either 'd' (directory),
	    '-' (ordinary file), 'l' (symbolic link), 'b' (block-oriented device) or
	    'c' (character-oriented device).
	  </li>

	  <li><i>permissions</i> is a set of characters describing access
	    rights. There are 9 permission characters, describing 3 access types given
	    to 3 user categories. The three access types are read ('r'), write ('w')
	    and execute ('x'), and the three users categories are the user who owns
	    the file, users in the group that the file belongs to and other users (the
	    general public). An 'r', 'w' or 'x' character means the corresponding permission
	    is present; a '-' means it is absent.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <i>links</i> refers to the number of filesystem links pointing
	    to the file/directory (see the discussion on hard/soft links in the next
	    section).
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <i>owner</i> is usually the user who created the file or
	    directory.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <i>group</i> denotes a collection of users who are allowed
	    to access the file according to the group access rights specified in the
	    permissions field.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	    <i>size </i>is the length of a file, or the number of bytes
	    used by the operating system to store the list of files in a directory.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <i>date </i>is the date when the file or directory was last
	    modified (written to). The <b>-u</b> option display the time when the
	    file was last accessed (read).</li>

	  <li>
	    <i>name </i>is the name of the file or directory.
	  </li>
	</ul>

<p><br><tt>ls</tt> supports more options. To find out what
they are, type:</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ man ls</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p><tt>man </tt>is the online UNIX user manual, and you can
use it to get help with commands and find out about what options are supported.
It has quite a terse style which is often not that helpful, so some users
prefer to the use the (non-standard) <tt>info</tt> utility if it is installed:</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ info ls</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>cd</tt> (change [current working] directory)</font></li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cd</tt> <i>path</i></font>
<p>changes your current working directory to <i>path</i>
(which can be an absolute or a relative path). One of the most common relative
paths to use is '..' (i.e. the parent directory of the current directory).</font>
<p>Used without any target directory</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cd</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>resets your current working directory to your home directory
(useful if you get lost). If you change into a directory and you subsequently
want to return to your original directory, use</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cd -</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>mkdir</tt> (make directory)</font></li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ mkdir </tt><i>directory</i></font>
<p>creates a subdirectory called&nbsp; <i>directory</i>in
the current working directory. You can only create subdirectories in a
directory if you have write permission on that directory.</font></ul>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>rmdir </tt>(remove directory)</font></li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ rmdir </tt><i>directory</i></font>
<p>removes the subdirectory <i>directory</i> from the current
working directory. You can only remove subdirectories if they are completely
empty (i.e. of all entries besides the '.' and '..' directories).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>cp</tt> (copy)</font></li>

<p><tt>cp</tt> is used to make copies of files or entire
directories. To copy files, use:</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cp </tt><i>source-file(s) destination</i></font>
<p>where <i>source-file(s)</i> and <i>destination</i> specify
the source and destination of the copy respectively. The behaviour of <tt>cp</tt>
depends on whether the destination<i> </i>is a file or a directory. If
the destination is a file, only one source file is allowed and <tt>cp</tt>
makes a new file called <i>destination</i> that has the same contents as
the source file. If the destination is a directory, many source files can
be specified, each of which will be copied into the destination directory.
Section 2.6 will discuss efficient specification of source files using
wildcard characters.</font>
<p>To copy entire directories (including their contents),
use a <i>recursive</i> copy:</font>
<p>&nbsp;<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cp -rd </tt><i>source-directories
destination-directory</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>mv</tt> (move/rename)</font></li>

<p><tt>mv</tt> is used to rename files/directories and/or
move them from one directory into another. Exactly one source and one destination
must be specified:</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ mv </tt><i>source destination</i></font>
<p>If <i>destination</i> is an existing directory, the new
name for <i>source</i> (whether it be a file or a directory) will&nbsp;
be <i>destination<tt>/</tt>source</i>. If <i>source</i> and <i>destination</i>
are both files, <i>source</i> is renamed <i>destination</i>. N.B.: if <i>destination</i>
is an existing file it will be destroyed and overwritten by<i> source</i>
(you can use the <tt>-i</tt> option if you would like to be asked for confirmation
before a file is overwritten in this way).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>rm </tt>(remove/delete)</font></li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ rm </tt><i>target-file(s)</i></font>
<p>removes the specified files. Unlike other operating systems,
it is almost impossible to recover a deleted file unless you have a backup
(there is no recycle bin!) so use this command with care. If you would
like to be asked before files are deleted, use the <tt>-i </tt>option:</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ rm -i myfile</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rm: remove 'myfile'?</font></tt>
<p><tt>rm</tt> can also be used to delete directories (along
with all of their contents, including any subdirectories they contain).
To do this, use the
<tt>-r</tt> option. To avoid <tt>rm</tt> from asking
any questions or giving errors (e.g. if the file doesn't exist) you used
the <tt>-f </tt>(force) option. Extreme care needs to be taken when using
this option - consider what would happen if a system administrator was
trying to delete user<tt> will</tt>'s home directory and accidentally typed:</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ rm -rf / home/will</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>(instead of<tt> rm -rf /home/will</tt>).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>cat</tt> (catenate/type)</font></li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cat </tt><i>target-file(s)</i></font>
<p>displays the contents of <i>target-file(s)&nbsp;</i> on
the screen, one after the other. You can also use it to create files from
keyboard input as follows (<tt>></tt> is the output redirection operator,
which will be discussed in the next chapter):</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cat > hello.txt</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello world!</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>[ctrl-d]</font>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ ls hello.txt</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello.txt</font></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cat hello.txt</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello world!</font></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $</font></tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>more</tt> and <tt>less</tt> (catenate with pause)</font></li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ more </tt><i>target-file(s)</i></font>
<p>displays the contents of <i>target-file(s)&nbsp;</i> on
the screen, pausing at the end of each screenful and asking the user to
press a key (useful for long files). It also incorporates a searching facility
(press '<tt>/</tt>' and then type a phrase that you want to look for).</font>
<p>You can also use <tt>more</tt> to break up the output
of commands that produce more than one screenful of output as follows (<tt>|
</tt>is
the pipe operator, which will be discussed in the next chapter):</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ ls -l | more</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p><tt>less</tt> is just like <tt>more</tt>, except that
has a few extra features (such as allowing users to scroll backwards and
forwards through the displayed file). <tt>less</tt> not a standard utility,
however and may not be present on all UNIX systems.</font></ul>

Making Hard and Soft (Symbolic) Links
</div>
</div>
<br>

<div class="text">

<blockquote>Direct (hard) and indirect (soft or symbolic)
links from one file or directory to another can be created using the <tt>ln</tt>
command.</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ ln </tt><i>filename linkname</i></font>
<p>creates another directory entry for <i>filename</i> called
<i>linkname
</i>(i.e.
<i>linkname</i>
is a hard link). Both directory entries appear identical (and both now
have a link count of 2). If either <i>filename</i> or <i>linkname</i> is
modified, the change will be reflected in the other file (since they are
in fact just two different directory entries pointing to the same file).</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ ln -s </tt><i>filename linkname</i></font>
<p>creates a shortcut called <i>linkname</i> (i.e. <i>linkname</i>
is a soft link). The shortcut appears as an entry with a special type ('<tt>l</tt>'):</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ ln -s hello.txt bye.txt</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ ls -l bye.txt</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lrwxrwxrwx&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 will
finance 13 bye.txt -> hello.txt</font></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $</font></tt>
<p>The link count of the source file remains unaffected.
Notice that the permission bits on a symbolic link are not used (always
appearing as <tt>rwxrwxrwx</tt>). Instead the permissions on the link are
determined by the permissions on the target (<tt>hello.txt</tt> in this
case).</font>
<p>Note that you can create a symbolic link to a file that
doesn't exist, but not a hard link. Another difference between the two
is that you can create symbolic links across different physical disk devices
or partitions, but hard links are restricted to the same disk partition.
Finally, most current UNIX implementations do not allow hard links to point
to directories.</font></blockquote>

<div class="table">
2.6 Specifying multiple filenames
</div>
</div>
<br>

<div class="text">
Multiple filenames can be specified using special
pattern-matching characters. The rules are:

<ul>
<li>'<tt>?</tt>' matches any single character in that position
in the filename.</li>
<li>'<tt>*</tt>' matches zero or more characters in the filename.
A '<tt>*</tt>' on its own will match all files. '<tt>*.*</tt>' matches
all files with containing a '<tt>.</tt>'.</li>
<li>Characters enclosed in square brackets ('[' and ']') will
match any filename that has one of those characters in that position.</li>

<li>A list of comma separated strings enclosed in curly braces
("{" and "}") will be expanded as a Cartesian product with the surrounding
characters.</li>
For example:
<ol>
<li><tt>??? </tt>matches all three-character filenames.</li>

<li><tt>?ell?</tt> matches any five-character filenames with
'<tt>ell</tt>' in the middle.</li>

<li><tt>he*</tt> matches any filename beginning with '<tt>he</tt>'.</li>

<li><tt>[m-z]*[a-l]</tt> matches any filename that begins with
a letter from '<tt>m</tt>' to '<tt>z</tt>' and ends in a letter from '<tt>a</tt>'
to '<tt>l</tt>'.</li>

<li><tt>{/usr,}{/bin,/lib}/file</tt> expands to <tt>/usr/bin/file
/usr/lib/file /bin/file </tt>and<tt> /lib/file</tt>.</li>
</ol>

Note that the UNIX shell performs these expansions (including
any filename matching) on a command's arguments <i>before</i> the command
is executed.
</div>

<br>

<div class="heading">
<div class="table">
2.7 Quotes
</div>
</div>
<br>

<div class="text">
As we have seen certain special characters (e.g.
'<tt>*</tt>', '<tt>-</tt>','<tt>{</tt>' etc.) are interpreted in a special
way by the shell. In order to pass arguments that use these characters
to commands directly (i.e. without filename expansion etc.), we need to
use special quoting characters. There are three levels of quoting that
you can try:

<ol>
<li>Try insert a '<tt>\</tt>' in front of the special character.</li>
<li>Use double quotes (<tt>"</tt>) around arguments to prevent
most expansions.</li>
<li>Use single forward quotes (<tt>'</tt>) around arguments to
prevent all expansions.</li>
</ol>
There is a fourth type of quoting in UNIX. Single backward
quotes (<tt>`</tt>) are used to pass the output of some command as an input
argument to another. For example:</font>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ hostname</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rose</font></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ echo this machine is called
`hostname`</font></tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this machine is called rose</font></tt></blockquote>

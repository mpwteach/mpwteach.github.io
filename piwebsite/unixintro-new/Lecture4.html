      This lecture covers:

      <ul>
	<li>The concept of a process.</li>
	<li>Passing output from one process as input to another using pipes.</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>4.2 Processes</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>A <b>process</b> is a program in execution. Every time you invoke a system utility or an
	application program from a shell, one or more "child" processes are created
	by the shell in response to your command. All UNIX processes are identified
	by a unique process identifier or PID. An important process that is always
	present is the <b>init</b> process. This is the first process to be created
	when a UNIX system starts up and usually has a PID of 1. All other processes
	are said to be "descendants" of <b>init</b>.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>4.3 Pipes</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>The pipe ('<b>|</b>') operator is used to create
	concurrently executing processes that pass data directly to one another.
	It is useful for combining system utilities to perform more complex functions.
	For example:</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ cat hello.txt | sort | uniq</p>
      <p>creates three processes (corresponding to <b>cat</b>, <b>sort</b> and <b>uniq</b>)
	which execute concurrently. As they execute, the output of the who process
	is passed on to the <b>sort </b>process which is in turn passed on to
	the <b>uniq</b> process. <b>uniq</b> displays its output on the screen
	(a sorted list of users with duplicate lines removed). Similarly:
      <p class="terminal">$ cat hello.txt | grep "dog" | grep -v "cat"</p>
      <p>finds all lines in <b>hello.txt</b> that contain the
	string "<b>dog</b>" but do not contain the string "<b>cat</b>".</p>

    </div>

    <h2>4.4 Redirecting input and output</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>The output from programs is usually written to
	the screen, while their input usually comes from the keyboard (if no file
	arguments are given). In technical terms, we say that processes usually
	write to <b>standard output</b> (the screen)
	and take their input from <b>standard input</b>(the
	keyboard). There is in fact another output channel called <b>standard error</b>,
	where processes write their error messages; by default
	error messages are also sent to the screen.</p>

      <p>To redirect standard output to a file instead of the screen,
	we use the <b>&gt;</b> operator:</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ echo hello
	<br>hello
	<br>$ echo hello > output
	<br>$ cat output
	<br>hello</p>
      
      <p>In this case, the contents of the file <b>output</b>
	will be destroyed if the file already exists. If instead we want to append
	the output of the echo command to the file, we can use the >> operator:</p>
      
      <p class="terminal">$ echo bye >> output
	<br>$ cat output
	<br>hello
	<br>bye</p>
      
      <p>To capture standard error, prefix the <b>&gt;</b> operator
	with a 2 (in UNIX the file numbers 0, 1 and 2 are assigned to standard
	input, standard output and standard error respectively), e.g.:</p>
      
      <p class="terminal">$ cat nonexistent 2>errors
	<br>$ cat errors
	<br>cat: nonexistent: No such file or directory</p>
      
      <p>You can redirect standard error and standard output to
	two different files:</p>
      
      <p class="terminal">$ find . -print 1>errors 2>files</p>
      <p>or to the same file:</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ find . -print 1>output 2>output</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ find . -print >&amp; output</p>
      
      <p>Standard input can also be redirected using the <b>&lt;</b>
	operator, so that input is read from a file instead of the keyboard:</p>
      
      <p class="terminal">$ cat &lt; output
	<br>hello
	<br>bye</p>
      
      <p>You can combine input redirection with output redirection,
	but be careful not to use the same filename in both places. For example:</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ cat &lt; output &gt; output</p>
      
      <p>will destroy the contents of the file <b>output</b>.
	This is because the first thing the shell does when it sees the <b>&gt;</b>
	operator is to create an empty file ready for the output.</p>
      <p>One last point to note is that we can pass standard output
	to system utilities that require filenames as "<b>-</b>":</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ cat package.tar.gz | gzip -d | tar tvf -</p>
      <p>Here the output of the <b>gzip -d</b> command is used
	as the input file to the <b>tar</b> command.</p>

    <h2>4.5 Controlling processes associated with the current shell</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>Most shells provide sophisticated job control
	facilities that let you control many running jobs (i.e. processes) at the
	same time. This is useful if, for example, you are editing a text file
	and want ot interrupt your editing to do something else. With job control,
	you can suspend the editor, go back to the shell prompt, and start work
	on something else. When you are finished, you can switch back to the editor
	and continue as if you hadn't left.</p>
      <p>Jobs can either be in the <b>foreground</b>
	or the <b>background</b>. There can be only
	one job in the foreground at any time. The foreground job has control of
	the shell with which you interact - it receives input from the keyboard
	and sends output to the screen. Jobs in the background do not receive input
	from the terminal, generally running along quietly without the need for
	interaction (and drawing it to your attention if they do).</p>
      <p>The foreground job may be suspended, i.e. temporarily
	stopped, by pressing the Ctrl-Z key. A suspended job can be made to continue
	running in the foreground or background as needed by typing <b>fg</b>
	or <b>bg</b> respectively. Note that suspending a job is very different
	from interrupting a job (by pressing the interrupt key, usually Ctrl-C);
	interrupted jobs are killed off permanently and cannot be resumed.</p>
      <p>Background jobs can also be run directly from the command
	line, by appending a <b>&amp;</b> character to the command line. For
	example:</p>
      
      <p class="terminal">$ find / -print 1>output 2>errors &amp;
	<br>[1] 27501
	<br>$</p>
      
      <p>Here the <b>[1]</b> returned by the shell represents
	the job number of the background process, and the 27501 is the PID of the
	process. To see a list of all the jobs associated with the current shell,
	type <b>jobs</b>:</p>

      <p class="terminal">$ jobs
	<br>[1]+&nbsp; Running&nbsp; find / -print 1>output 2>errors &amp;
	<br>$</p>

      <p>Note that if you have more than one job you can refer
	to the job as <b>%n</b> where <b>n </b>is the job number. So for example
	<b>fg %3</b> resumes job number 3 in the foreground.</p>
      <p>To find out the process ID's of the underlying processes
	associated with the shell and its jobs, use <b>ps</b> (process show):</p>

      <p class="terminal">$ ps
	<br>PID TTY TIME CMD
	<br>17717 pts/10&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:00:00 bash
	<br>27501 pts/10&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:00:01 find
	<br>27502 pts/10&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:00:00 ps</p>

      <p>So here the PID of the shell (<b>bash</b>) is 17717,
	the PID of <b>find</b> is 27501 and the PID of <b>ps</b> is 27502.</p>
      <p>To terminate a process or job abrubtly, use the <b>kill</b>
	command. <b>kill</b> allows jobs to referred to in two ways - by
	their PID or by their job number. So</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ kill %1</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ kill 27501</p>
      <p>would terminate the <b>find</b> process. Actually kill
	only sends the process a signal requesting it shutdown and exit gracefully
	(the SIGTERM signal), so this may not always work. To force a process to
	terminate abruptly (and with a higher probability of sucess), use a <b>-9</b>
	option (the SIGKILL signal):</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ kill -9 27501</p>
      <p><b>kill</b> can be used to send many other types of
	signals to running processes. For example a <b>-19</b> option (SIGSTOP)
	will suspend a running process. To see a list of such signals, run <b>kill -l.</b></p>

    </div>
    
    <h2>4.6 Controlling other processes</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>You can also use <b>ps</b> to show all processes
	running on the machine (not just the processes in your current shell):</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ ps -aux</p>
      
      <p><b>ps -aeH</b> displays a full process hierarchy
	(including the <b>init</b> process).</p>
      <p>Many UNIX versions have a system utility called <b>top</b>
	that provides an interactive way to monitor system activity. Detailed statistics
	about currently running processes are displayed and constantly refreshed.
	Processes are displayed in order of CPU utilization. Useful keys in
	<b>top</b> are:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><b>s - </b> set update frequency</li>
	<li><b>k - </b> kill process (by PID)</li>
	<li><b>u - </b> display processes of one user </li>
	<li><b>q - </b> quit</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>On some systems, the utility <b>w</b> is a non-interactive
	substitute for <b>top</b>.</p>
      <p>One other useful process control utility that can be found
	on most UNIX systems is the <b>pkill</b> command. You can use
	<b>pkill</b> to kill processes by name instead of PID or job number. So another way
	to kill off our background <b>find</b> process (along with any another
	<b>find</b> processes we are running) would be:</p>
      <p class="terminal">$ pkill find
	<br>[1]+&nbsp; Terminated find / -print 1>output 2>errors
	<br>$</p>
      <p>Note that, for obvious security reasons, you can only
	kill processes that belong to you (unless you are the superuser).</p>

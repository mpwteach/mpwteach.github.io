<div class="text">

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Copy the file <A href="mole.txt"><tt>mole.txt</tt></A> into your home
directory (press shift and the left mouse button to download the file using Netscape).</font></li>

<li>
Edit your copy of the document using <tt>vi</tt>.</font></li>

<li>
Go to the end of the document and type in the following paragraph:<br>
<br>
<tt>Joined the library. Got Care of the Skin, Origin of the Species, and
a book by a woman my mother is always going on about. It is called Pride
and Prejudice, by a woman called Jane Austen. I could tell the librarian
was impressed. Perhaps she is an intellectual like me. She didn't look
at my spot, so perhaps it is getting smaller.</tt></font></li>

<li>
Correct&nbsp; the three&nbsp; spelling errors in the first
three lines of the first paragraph (one&nbsp; error per&nbsp; line) and&nbsp;
remove the extra "<tt>Geography</tt>" in the 3rd line of the first paragraph.</font></li>

<li>
Add the words "<tt>About time!</tt>" to the end of the second
paragraph.</font></li>

<li>
Delete&nbsp; the sentence&nbsp; "<tt>Time flies like an arrow
but&nbsp; fruit flies like a banana</tt>" and re-form the paragraph.</font></li>

<li>
Replace all occurrences of "<tt>is</tt>" with "<tt>was</tt>".</font></li>

<li>
Swap the two paragraphs.</font></li>

<li>
Save the file and quit.</font></li>

<li>
Repeat the exercise with <tt>emacs</tt>. Which did you find
easier?</font></li>

<li>
Can you write a simple C&nbsp;program (say the hello world
program) and <tt>makefile</tt>, compile and run it - all from inside <tt>emacs</tt>?</font></li>

<li>
If you'd like an indepth <tt>vi</tt> tutorial try running
"<tt>vimtutor</tt>". For an indepth <tt>emacs</tt> tutorial, type <tt>M-x
help-with-tutorial</tt> from inside <tt>emacs</tt>.</font></li>
</ol>

<div class="caption">Fig 3.1: Interpretation of permissions for files
and directories</div>

<br>

As we have seen in the previous chapter, every
file or directory on a UNIX system has three types of permissions, describing
what operations can be performed on it by various categories of users.
The permissions are read (<tt>r</tt>), write (<tt>w</tt>) and execute (<tt>x</tt>),
and the three categories of users are user/owner (<tt>u</tt>), group (<tt>g</tt>)
and others (<tt>o</tt>). Because files and directories are different entities,
the interpretation of the permissions assigned to each differs slightly,
as shown in Fig 3.1.

File and directory permissions can only be modified
by their owners, or by the superuser (<tt>root</tt>), by using the <tt>chmod</tt>
system utility.
<ul>
<li>
<tt>chmod </tt>(change [file or directory] mode)</li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ chmod </tt><i>options files</i>
<p><tt>chmod</tt> accepts options in two forms. Firstly,
permissions may be specified as a sequence of 3 octal digits (octal is
like decimal except that the digit range is 0 to 7 instead of 0 to 9).
Each octal digit represents the access permissions for the user/owner,
group and others respectively. The mappings of permissions onto their corresponding
octal digits is as follows:

<center><table>
  <tr>
    <td>---</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>--x</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-w-</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-wx</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>r--</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>r-x</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rw-</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rwx</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<p>For example the command:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ chmod 600 private.txt</tt>
<p>sets the permissions on <tt>private.txt</tt> to <tt>rw-------</tt>
(i.e. only the owner can read and write to the file).
<p>Permissions may be specified symbolically, using the symbols
<tt>u</tt>
(user), <tt>g</tt> (group), <tt>o</tt> (other), <tt>a</tt> (all),
<tt>r</tt>
(read), <tt>w</tt> (write), <tt>x</tt> (execute), <tt>+</tt> (add permission),
<tt>-</tt>
(take away permission) and <tt>=</tt> (assign permission). For example,
the command:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ chmod ug=rw,o-rw,a-x *.txt</tt>
<p>sets the permissions on all files ending in <tt>*.txt</tt>
to <tt>rw-rw----</tt> (i.e. the owner and users in the file's group can
read and write to the file, while the general public do not have any sort
of access).
<p><tt>chmod</tt> also supports a <tt>-R</tt> option which
can be used to recursively modify file permissions, e.g.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ chmod -R go+r play</tt>
<p>will grant group and other read rights to the directory
<tt>play</tt>
and all of the files and directories within <tt>play</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>chgrp</tt> (change group)</li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ chgrp </tt><i>group files</i>
<p>can be used to change the group that a file or directory
belongs to. It also supports a <tt>-R</tt> option.</ul>

</div>
<br>

<div class="heading">
<div class="table">
3.3 Inspecting File Content
</div>
</div>

<div class="text">

Besides <tt>cat </tt>there are several other
useful utilities for investigating the contents of files:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>file</tt> <i>filename(s)</i></li>

<p><tt>file </tt>analyzes a file's contents for you and reports
a high-level description of what type of file it appears to be:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ file myprog.c letter.txt webpage.html</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myprog.c:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C program text</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letter.txt:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
English text</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; webpage.html:&nbsp; HTML document
text</tt>
<p><i>file</i> can identify a wide range of files but sometimes
gets understandably confused (e.g. when trying to automatically detect
the difference between C++ and Java code).
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>head, tail</tt> <i>filename</i></li>

<p><tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt> display the first and
last few lines in a file respectively. You can specify the number of lines
as an option, e.g.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ tail -20 messages.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ head -5 messages.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p><tt>tail </tt>includes a useful <tt>-f</tt> option that
can be used to continuously monitor the last few lines of a (possibly changing)
file. This can be used to monitor log files, for example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ tail -f /var/log/messages</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>continuously outputs the latest additions to the system
log file.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>objdump</tt> <i>options binaryfile</i></li>

<p><tt>objdump</tt> can be used to disassemble binary
files - that is it can show the machine language instructions which make
up compiled application programs and system utilities.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>od</tt> <i>options filename</i> (octal dump)</li>

<p><tt>od</tt> can be used to displays the contents of
a binary or text file in a variety of formats, e.g.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cat hello.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello world</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ od -c hello.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000000&nbsp; h&nbsp; e&nbsp;
l&nbsp; l&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w&nbsp; o&nbsp; r&nbsp; l&nbsp;
d \n</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000014</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ od -x hello.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000000 6865 6c6c 6f20 776f 726c
640a</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000014</tt></ul>
There are also several other useful content inspectors that
are non-standard (in terms of availability on UNIX systems) but are nevertheless
in widespread use. They are summarised in Fig. 3.2.

3.4 Finding Files
</div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="text">

There are at least three ways to find files when
you don't know their exact location:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>find</tt></li>

<p>If you have a rough idea of the directory tree the file
might be in (or even if you don't and you're prepared to wait a while)
you can use <tt>find</tt>:
<p><tt>&nbsp;$ find </tt><i>directory</i><tt> -name </tt><i>targetfile</i><tt>
-print&nbsp;</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p><tt>find</tt> will look for a file called <i>targetfile</i>
in any part of the directory tree rooted at <i>directory</i>. <i>targetfile</i>
can include wildcard characters. For example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;$ find /home -name "*.txt" -print 2>/dev/null</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>will search all user directories for any file ending in
"<tt>.txt</tt>" and output any matching files (with a full absolute or
relative path). Here the quotes (<tt>"</tt>) are necessary to avoid filename
expansion, while the <tt>2>/dev/null </tt>suppresses error messages (arising
from errors such as not being able to read the contents of directories
for which the user does not have the right permissions).
<p><tt>find</tt> can in fact do a lot more than just find
files by name. It can find files by type (e.g.<tt> -type f</tt> for files,
<tt>-type
d</tt> for directories), by permissions (e.g. <tt>-perm o=r</tt> for all
files and directories that can be read by others), by size (<tt>-size</tt>)
etc. You can also execute commands on the files you find. For example,
<p>&nbsp;<tt>$ find . -name "*.txt" -exec wc -l '{}' ';'</tt>
<p>counts the number of lines in every text file in and below
the current directory. The <tt>'{}' </tt>is replaced by the name of each
file found and the <tt>';'</tt> ends the <tt>-exec</tt> clause.
<p>For more information about <tt>find</tt> and its abilities,
use <tt>man find</tt> and/or <tt>info find</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>which</tt> (sometimes also called <tt>whence</tt>) <i>command</i></li>

<p>If you can execute an application program or system utility
by typing its name at the shell prompt, you can use <tt>which</tt> to find
out where it is stored on disk. For example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ which ls</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /bin/ls</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>locate </tt><i>string</i></li>

<p><tt>find</tt> can take a long time to execute if you are
searching a large filespace (e.g. searching from <tt>/</tt> downwards).
The <tt>locate
</tt>command provides a much faster way of locating all
files whose names match a particular search string. For example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ locate ".txt"</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>will find all filenames in the filesystem that contain
"<tt>.txt</tt>" anywhere in their full paths.
<p>One disadvantage of <tt>locate</tt> is it stores all filenames
on the system in an index that is usually updated only once a day. This
means <tt>locate</tt> will not find files that have been created very recently.
It may also report filenames as being present even though the file has
just been deleted. Unlike <tt>find</tt>, <tt>locate </tt>cannot track down
files on the basis of their permissions, size and so on.

<br>

<div class="heading">
<div class="table">
3.5 Finding Text in Files
</div>
</div>

<div class="text">

<ul>
<li>
<tt>grep</tt> (General Regular Expression Print)</li>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ grep </tt><i>options pattern
files</i><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p><tt>grep </tt>searches the named files (or standard input
if no files are named) for lines that match a given pattern. The default
behaviour of <tt>grep</tt> is to print out the matching lines. For example:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ grep hello *.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>searches all text files in the current directory for lines
containing "hello". Some of the more useful options that <tt>grep</tt>
provides are:
<br><tt>-c</tt> (print a count of the number of lines that
match), <tt>-i</tt> (ignore case), <tt>-v</tt> (print out the lines that
don't match the pattern) and <tt>-n</tt> (printout the line number before
printing the matching line). So
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ grep -vi hello *.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>searches all text files in the current directory for lines
that do not contain any form of the word hello (e.g. Hello, HELLO, or hELlO).
<p>If you want to search all files in an entire directory
tree for a particular pattern, you can combine <tt>grep</tt> with <tt>find
</tt>using
backward single quotes to pass the output from <tt>find</tt> into <tt>grep</tt>.
So
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ grep hello `find . -name "*.txt"
-print`</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>will search all text files in the directory tree rooted
at the current directory for lines containing the word "hello".
<p>The patterns that <tt>grep</tt> uses are actually a special
type of pattern known as <b><font color="#3333FF">regular expressions</b></font>.
Just like arithemetic expressions, regular expressions are made up of basic
subexpressions combined by operators.
<p>The most fundamental expression is a regular expression
that matches a single character.&nbsp; Most characters, including all letters
and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.&nbsp; Any other
character with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash
(<tt>\</tt>). A list of characters enclosed by '<tt>[</tt>' and '<tt>]</tt>'
matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the
list is the caret `<tt>^</tt>', then it matches any character not in the
list. A range of characters can be specified using a dash (<tt>-</tt>)
between the first and last items in the list. So <tt>[0-9]</tt> matches
any digit and <tt>[^a-z]</tt> matches any character that is not a letter.
<p>The caret `<tt>^</tt>' and the dollar sign `<tt>$</tt>'
are special characters that
<br>match the beginning and end of a line respectively. The
dot '<tt>.</tt>' matches any character. So
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ grep ^..[l-z]$ hello.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>matches any line in <tt>hello.txt</tt> that contains a
three character sequence that ends with a lowercase letter from l to z.
<p><tt>egrep</tt> (extended grep) is a variant of grep that
supports more sophisticated regular expressions. Here two regular expressions
may be joined by the operator `<tt>|</tt>'; the resulting regular expression
matches any string matching either subexpression. Brackets '<tt>(</tt>'
and '<tt>)</tt>' may be used for grouping regular expressions. In addition,
a regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:
<p><tt>`?'</tt> means the preceding item is optional (matched
at most once).
<br><tt>`*'&nbsp;</tt> means the preceding item will be matched
zero or more times.
<br><tt>`+'</tt> means the preceding item will be matched
one or more times.
<br><tt>`{N}'&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> means the preceding item is
matched exactly N times.
<br><tt>`{N,}'&nbsp;</tt> means the preceding item is matched
N or more times.
<br><tt>`{N,M}'</tt> means the preceding item is matched
at least N times, but not more than M times.
<p>For example, if <tt>egrep</tt> was given the regular expression
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '(^[0-9]{1,5}[a-zA-Z ]+$)|none'</tt>
<p>it would match any line that either:
<ul>
<li>
begins with a number up to five digits long, followed by
a sequence of one or more letters or spaces, or</li>

<li>
contains the word <tt>none</tt></li>
</ul>
You can read more about regular expressions on the
<tt>grep</tt>
and <tt>egrep </tt>manual pages.
<p>Note that UNIX systems also usually support another <tt>grep</tt>
variant called <tt>fgrep</tt> (fixed grep) which simply looks for a fixed
string inside a file (but this facility is largely redundant).

<div class="heading">
<div class="table">
3.6 Sorting files
</div>
</div>

<div class="text">

There are two facilities that are useful for
sorting files in UNIX:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>sort</tt> <i>filenames</i></li>

<p><tt>sort</tt> sorts lines contained in a group of files
alphabetically (or if the <tt>-n</tt> option is specified) numerically.
The sorted output is displayed on the screen, and may be stored in another
file by redirecting the output. So
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ sort input1.txt input2.txt >
output.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>outputs the sorted concentenation of files <tt>input1.txt</tt>
and
<tt>input2.txt </tt>to the file <tt>output.txt</tt>.<br>

<li>
<tt>uniq </tt><i>filename</i></li>

<p><tt>uniq </tt>removes duplicate adjacent lines from a
file. This facility is most useful when combined with <tt>sort</tt>:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ sort input.txt | uniq > output.txt</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27></ul>

</div>
<br>

<div class="heading">
<div class="table">
3.7 File Compression and Backup
</div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="text">

UNIX systems usually support a number of utilities
for backing up and compressing files. The most useful are:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>tar</tt> (tape archiver)</li>

<p><tt>tar</tt> backs up entire directories and files onto
a tape device or (more commonly) into a single disk file known as an archive.
An archive is a file that contains other files plus information about them,
such as&nbsp; their filename, owner, timestamps, and access permissions.
<tt>tar</tt>
does not perform any compression by default.
<p>To create a disk file <tt>tar</tt> archive, use
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ tar -cvf </tt><i>archivenamefilenames</i>
<p>where <i>archivename</i> will usually have a <tt>.tar</tt>
extension. Here the <tt>c</tt> option means create, <tt>v</tt> means verbose
(output filenames as they are archived), and <tt>f</tt> means file.To list
the contents of a <tt>tar</tt> archive, use
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ tar -tvf </tt><i>archivename</i>
<p>To restore files from a <tt>tar</tt> archive, use
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ tar -xvf </tt><i>archivename</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>cpio</tt></li>

<p><tt>cpio </tt>is another facility for creating and reading
archives. Unlike <tt>tar</tt>, <tt>cpio</tt> doesn't automatically archive
the contents of directories, so it's common to combine <tt>cpio</tt> with
<tt>find</tt>
when creating an archive:
<p><tt>$ find . -print -depth | cpio -ov -Htar > </tt><i>archivename</i>
<p>This will take all the files in the current directory
and the
<br>directories below and place them in an archive called
<i>archivename</i>.The
<tt>-depth</tt>
option controls the order in which the filenames are produced and is recommended
to prevent problems with directory permissions when doing a restore.The
<tt>-o</tt>
option creates the archive, the <tt>-v</tt> option prints the names of
the files archived as they are added and the
<tt>-H</tt> option&nbsp; specifies
an archive format type (in this case it creates a <tt>tar</tt> archive).
Another common archive type is <tt>crc</tt>, a portable format with a checksum
for error control.
<p>To list the contents of a <tt>cpio</tt> archive, use
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cpio -tv &lt; </tt><i>archivename</i>
<p>To restore files, use:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cpio -idv &lt; </tt><i>archivename</i>
<p>Here the <tt>-d</tt> option will create directories as
necessary. To force <tt>cpio </tt>to extract files&nbsp; on top of files
of the same name that already exist (and have the same or later modification
time), use the <tt>-u</tt> option.<br>

<li>
<tt>compress</tt>, <tt>gzip</tt></li>

<p><tt>compress</tt> and <tt>gzip</tt> are utilities for
compressing and decompressing individual files (which may be or may not
be archive files). To compress files, use:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ compress </tt><i>filename</i>
<br>or
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ gzip </tt><i>filename</i>
<p>In each case, <i>filename</i> will be deleted and replaced
by a compressed file called <i>filename</i>.Z or <i>filename</i>.gz. To
reverse the compression process, use:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ compress -d filename</tt>
<br>or
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ gzip -d filename</tt></ul>

3.8 Handling Removable Media (e.g. floppy disks)
</div>
</div>

<div class="text">

<br>

UNIX supports tools for accessing removable media
such as CDROMs and floppy disks.
<ul>
<li>
<tt>mount, umount</tt></li>

<p>The <tt>mount</tt> command serves to attach the filesystem
found on some device to the filesystem tree. Conversely, the <tt>umount</tt>
command will detach it again (it is very important to remember to do this
when removing the floppy or CDROM). The file <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> contains
a list of devices and the points at which they will be attached to the
main filesystem:
<p><tt>$ cat /etc/fstab</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>/dev/fd0&nbsp;&nbsp; /mnt/floppy&nbsp; auto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rw,user,noauto&nbsp; 0 0</tt>
<br><tt>/dev/hdc&nbsp;&nbsp; /mnt/cdrom&nbsp;&nbsp; iso9660
ro,user,noauto&nbsp; 0 0</tt>
<p>In this case, the mount point for the floppy drive is
<tt>/mnt/floppy</tt>
and the mount point for the CDROM is <tt>/mnt/cdrom</tt>. To access a floppy
we can use:
<p><tt>$ mount /mnt/floppy</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>$ cd /mnt/floppy</tt><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><tt>$ ls (</tt>etc...)
<p>To force all changed data to be written back to the floppy
and to detach the floppy disk from the filesystem, we use:
<p><tt>$ umount /mnt/floppy</tt>

<p>If they are installed, the (non-standard) <tt>mtools</tt>
utilities provide a convenient way of accessing DOS-formatted floppies
without having to mount and unmount filesystems. You can use DOS-type commands
like "<tt>mdir a:</tt>", "<tt>mcopy a:*.* .</tt>", "<tt>mformat a:</tt>",
etc. (see the
<tt>mtools </tt>manual pages for more details).</ul>

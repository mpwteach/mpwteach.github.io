    <h2>1.2 What is an Operating System?</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>
	An operating system (OS) is a resource manager. 
	It takes the form of a set of software routines that allow users and application
	programs to access system resources (e.g.the CPU, memory, disks, modems, printers
	network cards etc.) in a safe, efficient and abstract way.
      </p>
     
      <p>
	For example, an OS ensures <b>safe</b>access
	to a printer by allowing only one application program to send data directly
	to the printer at any one time. An OS encourages <b>efficient</b> use
	of the CPU by suspending programs that are waiting for I/O operations to
	complete to make way for programs that can use the CPU more productively.
	An OS also provides convenient
	<b>abstractions</b>(such as files rather than disk locations) which isolate
	application programmers and users from the details of the underlying hardware.
      </p>

	<div class="caption">Fig. 1.1: General operating system architecture</div>
      </center>
	
      <p>Fig. 1.1 presents the architecture of a typical operating
	system and shows how an OS succeeds in presenting users and application
	programs with a uniform interface without regard to the details of the
	underlying hardware.
      </p>
      
      <p>We see that:</p>
	    
	<ul>
	  <li>	  
	    The operating system <b>kernel</b>
	    is in direct control of the underlying hardware. The kernel provides low-level
	    device, memory and processor management functions (e.g. dealing with interrupts
	    from hardware devices, sharing the processor among multiple programs, allocating
	    memory for programs etc.)
	    
	<li>
	  Basic hardware-independent kernel services are exposed to 
	  higher-level programs through a library of <b>system
	      calls </b>(e.g. services to create a file,
	    begin execution of a program, or open a logical network connection to another
	    computer).

	<li>
	  <b>Application programs</b> (e.g. word processors, spreadsheets) and
	  <b>system utility programs</b> (simple but useful application
	    programs that come with the operating system, e.g. programs which find
	    text inside a group of files) make use of system calls. Applications and
	    system utilities are launched using a <b>shell</b>
	    (a textual command line interface) or a <b>graphical
	      user interface</b> that provides direct user
	    interaction.
	</ul>
	
      <p>
	Operating systems (and different flavours of the same operating
	system) can be distinguished from one another by the system calls, system
	utilities and user interface they provide, as well as by the resource scheduling
	policies implemented by the kernel.
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <h2>1.3 A Brief History of UNIX</h2>

    <div class="text">    

      <p>
	UNIX has been a popular OS for more than two
	decades because of its multi-user, multi-tasking environment, stability,
	portability and powerful networking capabilities. What follows here is
	a simplified history of how UNIX has developed (to get an idea for how
	complicated things really are, see the web site 
	<a href="http://www.levenez.com/unix/">http://www.levenez.com/unix/</a>).
      </p>

	<div class="caption">Fig. 1.2: Simplified UNIX FamilyTree</div>
      </center>
      
      <p>
	In the late 1960s, researchers from General Electric,
	MIT and Bell Labs launched a joint project to develop an ambitious multi-user,
	multi-tasking OS for mainframe computers known as MULTICS (Multiplexed
	Information and Computing System). MULTICS failed (for 
	<a href="http://www.multicians.org/myths.html#fail69">some MULTICS enthusiasts</a> "failed" is perhaps too
	strong a word to use here), but it did inspire Ken
	Thompson, who was a researcher at Bell Labs, to have a go at writing a
	simpler operating system himself. He wrote a simpler version of MULTICS
	on a PDP7 in assembler and called his attempt UNICS (Uniplexed Information
	and Computing System). Because memory and CPU power were at a premium in
	those days, UNICS (eventually shortened to UNIX) used short commands to
	minimize the space needed to store them and the time needed to decode them
	- hence the tradition of short UNIX commands we use today, e.g. <tt>ls,
	  cp, rm, mv</tt> etc.
      </p>

      <p>
	Ken Thompson then teamed up with Dennis Ritchie, the author
	of the first C compiler in 1973. They rewrote the UNIX kernel in C - this
	was a big step forwards in terms of the system's portability - and released
	the Fifth Edition of UNIX to universities in 1974. The Seventh Edition,
	released in 1978, marked a split in UNIX development into two main branches:
	SYSV (System 5) and BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution). BSD arose from
	the University of California at Berkeley where Ken Thompson spent a sabbatical
	year. Its development was continued by students at Berkeley and other research
	institutions. SYSV was developed by AT&amp;T and other commercial companies.
	UNIX flavours based on SYSV have traditionally been more conservative,
	but better supported than BSD-based flavours.
      </p>
      <p>
	The latest incarnations of SYSV (SVR4 or System 5 Release
	4) and BSD Unix are actually very similar. Some minor differences are to
	be found in; file system structure, system utility names and options
	and system call libraries as shown in Fig 1.3.

      Fig. 1.3: Differences between SYSV and BSD
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Linux is a free open source UNIX OS for PCs that was originally
	developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish undergraduate student. Linux
	is neither pure SYSV or pure BSD. Instead, incorporates some features from
	each (e.g. SYSV-style startup files but BSD-style file system layout) and
	aims to conform with a set of IEEE standards called POSIX (Portable Operating
	System Interface). To maximise code portability, it typically supports
	SYSV, BSD and POSIX system calls (e.g.
	<tt>poll, select, memset, memcpy,
	  bzero</tt> and <tt>bcopy</tt> are all supported).
      <p>The open source nature of Linux means that the source
	code for the Linux kernel is freely available so that anyone can add features
	and correct deficiencies. This approach has been very successful and what
	started as one person's project has now turned into a collaboration of
	hundreds of volunteer developers from around the globe. The open source
	approach has not just successfully been applied to kernel code, but also
	to application programs for Linux (see e.g. <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">http://www.freshmeat.net</a>).
      <p>As Linux has become more popular, several different development
	streams or distributions have emerged, e.g. Redhat, Slackware, Mandrake,
	Debian, and Caldera. A distribution comprises a prepackaged kernel, system
	utilities, GUI interfaces and application programs.
      <p>Redhat is the most popular distribution because it has
	been ported to a large number of hardware platforms (including Intel, Alpha,
	and SPARC), it is easy to use and install and it comes with a comprehensive
	set of utilities and applications including the X Windows graphics system,
	GNOME and KDE GUI environments, and the StarOffice suite (an open source
	MS-Office clone for Linux).

    <h2>1.4 Architecture of the Linux Operating System</h2>
    

    <div class="text">
      Linux has all of the components of a typical
      OS (at this point you might like to refer back to Fig 1.1):
      <ul>
	<li> <b>Kernel</b></li>

	<p>
	  The Linux kernel includes device driver support for a large number of PC hardware
	  devices (graphics cards, network cards, hard
	  disks etc.), advanced processor and memory management features, and support
	  for many different types of filesystems (including DOS floppies and the
	  ISO9660 standard for CDROMs). In terms of the services that it provides
	  to application programs and system utilities, the kernel implements most
	  BSD and SYSV system calls, as well as the system calls described in the
	  POSIX.1 specification.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The kernel (in raw binary form that is loaded directly
	  into memory at system startup time) is typically found in the file /boot/vmlinuz,
	  while the source files can usually be found in /usr/src/linux.The latest
	  version of the Linux kernel sources can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a>.
	</p>
	
	<li><b>Shells and GUIs</b></li>

	<p>
	  Linux supports two forms of command input: through textual
	  command line shells similar to those found on most UNIX systems (e.g. sh
	  - the Bourne shell, bash - the Bourne again shell and csh - the C shell)
	  and through graphical interfaces (GUIs) such as the KDE and GNOME window
	  managers. If you are connecting remotely to a server your access will typically
	  be through a command line shell.
	</p>
	
	<li><b>System Utilities</b></li>
	
	<p>
	  Virtually every system utility that you would expect
	  to find on standard implementations of UNIX (including every system utility
	  described in the POSIX.2 specification) has been ported to Linux. This
	  includes commands such as <tt>ls, cp, grep, awk, sed, bc, wc, more</tt>,
	  and so on. These system utilities are designed to be powerful tools that
	  do a single task extremely well (e.g. <tt>grep</tt> finds text inside files
	  while <tt>wc</tt> counts the number of words, lines and bytes inside a
	  file). Users can often solve problems by interconnecting these tools instead
	  of writing a large monolithic application program.
	</p>
	<p>Like other UNIX flavours, Linux's system utilities also
	  include server programs called <b>daemons</b>
	  which provide remote network and administration services (e.g. <tt>telnetd</tt>
	  and <tt>sshd</tt> provide remote login facilities, <tt>lpd</tt> provides
	  printing services,
	  <tt>httpd</tt> serves web pages, <tt>crond</tt> runs
	  regular system administration tasks automatically). A daemon (probably
	  derived from the Latin word which refers to a beneficient spirit who watches
	  over someone, or perhaps short for "Disk And Execution MONitor") is usually
	  spawned automatically at system startup and spends most of its time lying
	  dormant (lurking?) waiting for some event to occur.
	</p>
	
	<li><b>Application programs</b></li>

	<p>
	  Linux distributions typically come with several useful
	  application programs as standard. Examples include the <tt>emacs</tt> editor,
	  <tt>xv</tt>
	  (an image viewer), <tt>gcc</tt> (a C compiler), <tt>g++</tt> (a C++ compiler),
	  <tt>xfig</tt>
	  (a drawing package), <tt>latex</tt> (a powerful typesetting language) and
	  <tt>soffice</tt>
	  (StarOffice, which is an MS-Office style clone that can read and write
	  Word, Excel and PowerPoint files).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Redhat Linux also comes with <tt>rpm</tt>, the Redhat
	  Package Manager which makes it easy to install and uninstall application
	  programs.
	</p>
      </ul>

    </div>

    <h2>1.5 Logging into (and out of) UNIX Systems</h2>
    
    <div class="text">
  
      <b>Text-based (TTY) terminals</b>:
      <p>
	When you connect to a UNIX computer remotely (using telnet)
	or when you log in locally using a text-only terminal, you will see the
	prompt:
      </p>
      
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; login:</tt></p>
      <p>At this prompt, type in your usename and press the enter/return/<img src="enter.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=27>
	key. Remember that UNIX is case sensitive (i.e. Will, WILL and will are
	all different logins). You should then be prompted for your password:
      </p>
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; login: will</tt>
	<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password:</tt></p>
      <p>
	Type your password in at the prompt and press the enter/return/<img src="enter.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=27>
	key. Note that your password will not be displayed on the screen as you
	type it in.
      </p>
      <p>If you mistype your username or password you will get
	an appropriate message from the computer and you will be presented with
	the <tt>login:</tt> prompt again. Otherwise you should be presented with
	a shell prompt which looks something like this:
      </p>
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $</tt></p>
      <p>
	To log out of a text-based UNIX shell, type "exit" at
    the shell prompt (or if that doesn't work try "logout"; if that doesn't
	work press ctrl-d).
      </p>
      
      <p><b>Graphical terminals:</b>
      <p>
	If you're logging into a UNIX computer locally, or if
	you are using a remote login facility that supports graphics, you might
	instead be presented with a graphical prompt with login and password fields.
	Enter your user name and password in the same way as above (N.B. you may
	need to press the TAB key to move between fields).
      </p>
      <p>Once you are logged in, you should be presented with a
	graphical window manager that looks similar to the Microsoft Windows interface.
	To bring up a window containing a shell prompt look for menus or icons
	which mention the words "shell", "xterm", "console" or "terminal emulator".
      <p>
	To log out of a graphical window manager, look for menu
	options similar to "Log out" or "Exit".
      </p>

      <br>

    </div>

    <h2>1.6 Changing your password</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
	One of the things you should do when you log
	in for the first time is to change your password.
      </p>
      <p>
	The UNIX command to change your password is <tt>passwd</tt>:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>$ passwd</tt><img src="enter.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=27></p>
      <p>
	The system will prompt you for your old password, then
	for your new password. To eliminate any possible typing errors you have
	made in your new password, it will ask you to reconfirm your new password.
      </p>
      <p>Remember the following points when choosing your password:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  Avoid characters which might not appear on all keyboards,
	  e.g. '&pound;'.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The weakest link in most computer security is user passwords
	  so keep your password a secret, don't write it down and don't tell it to
	  anyone else. Also avoid dictionary words or words related to your personal
	  details (e.g. your boyfriend or girlfriend's name or your login).
	</li>
	<li>
	  Make it at least 7 or 8 characters long and try to use a
	  mix of letters, numbers and punctuation.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    
    <h2>1.7 General format of UNIX commands</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
	A UNIX command line consists of the name of a
	UNIX command (actually the "command" is the name of a built-in shell command,
	a system utility or an application program) followed by its "arguments"
	(options and the target filenames and/or expressions). The general syntax
	for a UNIX command is
      </p>
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ command -options targets</tt><img src="enter.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=27></p>
      <p>
	Here <tt>command</tt> can be though of as a verb, <tt>options
	</tt>as an adverb and <tt>targets</tt> as the direct objects of the verb. In the
	case that the user wishes to specify several options, these need not always
	be listed separately (the options can sometimes be listed altogether after
	a single dash).

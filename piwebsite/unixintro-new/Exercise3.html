<h1> Introduction to UNIX: Exercise Sheet Three</h1>

<div class="text">

<ol>
<li>
Describe three different ways of setting the permissions
on a file or directory to <tt>r--r--r--</tt>. Create a file and see if
this works.</font></li>

<li>
Team up with a partner. Copy <tt>/bin/sh</tt> to your home
directory. Type "<tt>chmod +s sh</tt>". Check the permissions on <tt>sh</tt>
in the directory listing. Now ask your partner to change into your home
directory and run the program <tt>./sh</tt>. Ask them to run the <tt>id</tt>
command. What's happened?&nbsp; Your partner can type <tt>exit</tt> to
return to their shell.</font></li>

<li>
What would happen if the system administrator created a <tt>sh</tt>
file in this way? Why is it sometimes necessary for a system administrator
to use this feature using programs other than <tt>sh</tt>?</font></li>

<li>
Delete <tt>sh</tt> from your home directory (or at least
to do a <tt>chmod -s sh</tt>).</font></li>

<li>
Modify the permissions on your home directory to make it
completely private. Check that your partner can't access your directory.
Now put the permissions back to how they were.</font></li>

<li>
Type <tt>umask 000</tt> and then create a file called <tt>world.txt</tt>
containing the words "<tt>hello world</tt>". Look at the permissions on
the file. What's happened? Now type <tt>umask 022 </tt>and create a file
called <tt>world2.txt</tt>. When might this feature be useful?</font></li>

<li>
Create a file called "<tt>hello.txt</tt>" in your home directory
using the command <tt>cat -u >&nbsp;hello.txt</tt>. Ask your partner to
change into your home directory and run <tt>tail -f hello.txt</tt>. Now
type several lines into <tt>hello.txt</tt>. What appears on your partner's
screen?</font></li>

<li>
Use <tt>find</tt> to display the names of all files in the
<tt>/home</tt> subdirectory tree. Can you do this without displaying errors
for files you can't read?</font></li>

<li>
Use <tt>find</tt> to display the names of all files in the
system that are bigger than 1MB.</font></li>

<li>
Use <tt>find</tt> and <tt>file</tt> to display all files
in the <tt>/home</tt> subdirectory tree, as well as a guess at what sort
of a file they are. Do this in two different ways.</font></li>

<li>
Use <tt>grep</tt> to isolate the line in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>
that contains your login details.</font></li>

<li>
Use <tt>find</tt> and <tt>grep</tt> and <tt>sort</tt> to
display a sorted list of all files in the <tt>/home</tt> subdirectory tree
that contain the word <tt>hello </tt>somewhere inside them.</font></li>

<li>
Use <tt>locate</tt> to find all filenames that contain the
word <tt>emacs</tt>. Can you combine this with <tt>grep</tt> to avoid displaying
all filenames containing the word <tt>lib</tt>?</font></li>

<li>
Create a file containing some lines that you think would
match the regular expression: <tt>(^[0-9]{1,5}[a-zA-z ]+$)|none</tt> and
some lines that you think would not match. Use <tt>egrep</tt> to see if
your intuition is correct.</font></li>

<li>
Archive the contents of your home directory (including any
subdirectories) using <tt>tar</tt> and <tt>cpio</tt>. Compress the <tt>tar</tt>
archive with <tt>compress</tt>, and the <tt>cpio</tt> archive with <tt>gzip</tt>.
Now extract their contents.</font></li>

<li>
On Linux systems, the file <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> is a constantly
generated random stream of characters. Can you use this file with <tt>od</tt>
to printout a random decimal number?</font></li>

<li>
Type <tt>mount</tt> (with no parameters) and try to interpret
the output.</font></li>
</ol>

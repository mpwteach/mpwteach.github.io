    <h2 id="s2">2.2 The UNIX Filesystem</h2>


    <div class="text">
      <p>
        The UNIX operating system is built around the
        concept of a filesystem which is used to store all of the information that
        constitutes the long-term state of the system. This state includes the
        operating system kernel itself, the executable files for the commands supported
        by the operating system, configuration information, temporary workfiles,
        user data, and various special files that are used to give controlled access
        to system hardware and operating system functions.

        Every item stored in a UNIX filesystem belongs to one
        of four types:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Ordinary files</b></li>
        Ordinary files can contain text, data, or program information.
        Files cannot contain other files or directories. Unlike other operating
        systems, UNIX filenames are not broken into a name part and an extension
        part (although extensions are still frequently used as a means to classify
        files). Instead they can contain any keyboard character except for '/'
        and be up to 256 characters long (note however that characters such as
        *,?,# and &amp; have special meaning in most shells and should not therefore
        be used in filenames). Putting spaces in filenames also makes them difficult
        to manipulate - rather use the underscore '_'.

        <br>
        <li><b>Directories</b></li>
        Directories are containers or folders that hold files,
        and other directories.

        <br>
        <li><b>Devices</b></li>
        To provide applications with easy access to hardware
        devices, UNIX allows them to be used in much the same way as ordinary files.
        There are two types of devices in UNIX - <b>block-oriented</b> devices
        which transfer data in blocks (e.g. hard disks) and <b>character-oriented</b>
        devices that transfer data on a byte-by-byte basis (e.g. modems and dumb
        terminals).
        <br>

        <li><b>Links</b></li>
        A link is a pointer to another file. There are two types
        of links - a <b>hard link</b> to a file is indistinguishable from the file
        itself. A <b>soft link</b> (or symbolic link) provides an indirect pointer
        or shortcut to a file. A soft link is implemented as a directory file entry
        containing a pathname.
      </ol>
    </div>
    

    <h2 id="s3">2.3 Typical UNIX Directory Structure</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        The UNIX filesystem is laid out as a hierarchical
        tree structure which is anchored at a special top-level directory known
        as the root (designated by a slash '/'). Because of the tree structure,
        a directory can have many child directories, but only one parent directory.
        Fig. 2.1 illustrates this layout.
      </p>
      
      <center>
        <img src="images/linuxfsystem.png">
        <div class="caption">Fig. 2.1: Part of a typical UNIX filesystem tree</div>
      </center>
      
      <p>
        To specify a location in the directory hierarchy, we must
        specify a path through the tree. The path to a location can be defined
        by an absolute path from the root /, or as a relative path from the current
        working directory. To specify a path, each directory along the route from
        the source to the destination must be included in the path, with each directory
        in the sequence being separated by a slash. To help with the specification
        of relative paths, UNIX provides the shorthand "<b>.</b>" for the current
        directory and "<b>..</b>" for the parent directory. For example, the
        absolute path to the directory "<b>play</b>" is <b>/home/will/play</b>,
        while the relative path to this directory from "<b>zeb</b>" is <b>../will/play</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fig. 2.2 shows some typical directories you will find
        on UNIX systems and briefly describes their contents. Note that these although
        these subdirectories appear as part of a seamless logical filesystem, they
        do not need be present on the same hard disk device; some may even be located
        on a remote machine and accessed across a network.
      </p>

      <div class="caption">Fig. 2.2: Typical UNIX directories</div>

      <p>
        When you log into UNIX, your current working directory
        is your user home directory. You can refer to your home directory at any
        time as "<b>~</b>" and the home directory of other users as "<b>~&lt;login&gt;</b>".
        So <b>~will/play</b> is another way for user <b>jane</b> to specify
        an absolute path to the directory
        <b>/homes/will/play</b>. User <b>will</b>
        may refer to the directory as <b>~/play.</b>
      </p>

    <h2 id="s4">2.4 Directory and File Handling Commands</h2>


    <div class="text">
      <p>
        This section describes some of the more important
        directory and file handling commands.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><b>pwd</b> (print [current] working directory)</li>

        <p><b>pwd</b> displays the full absolute path to the your
          current location in the filesystem. So
        </p>
        <p class="terminal">
          $ pwd<br>
          /usr/bin
        </p>
        
        <p>implies that <b>/usr/bin</b> is the current working directory.</p>
        

        <li><b>ls</b> (list directory)</li>

        <p>
          <b>ls</b> lists the contents of a directory. If no
          target directory is given, then the contents of the current working directory
          are displayed. So, if the current working directory is <b>/</b>,
        </p>
        <p class="terminal">
          $ ls<br>
          bin dev home mnt share usr var
          boot etc lib proc sbin tmp vol
        <p>
          Actually, <b>ls</b> doesn't show you <i>all</i> the
          entries in a directory - files and directories that begin with a dot (.)
          are hidden (this includes the directories '.' and '..' which are always
          present). The reason for this is that files that begin with a . usually
          contain important configuration information and should not be changed under
          normal circumstances. If you want to see all files, <b>ls</b> supports
          the <b>-a</b> option:
        </p>
        <p class="terminal">$ ls -a</p>
        <p>
          Even this listing is not that helpful - there are no hints
          to properties such as the size, type and ownership of files, just their
          names. To see more detailed information, use the <b>-l</b> option (long
          listing), which can be combined with the <b>-a</b> option as follows:
        <p class="terminal">$ ls -a -l</p>
        <p>(or, equivalently,)</p>
        <p class="terminal">
          $ ls -al
          <br>-rwxr-x--- 1 william marketing 0 Oct 31 11:06 test
        </p>

        <p>Each line of the output looks like this:</p>
        <img src="images/filedesc.png">

        <p>where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>type</i> is a single character which is either 'd' (directory),
            '-' (ordinary file), 'l' (symbolic link), 'b' (block-oriented device) or
            'c' (character-oriented device).
          </li>

          <li><i>permissions</i> is a set of characters describing access
            rights. There are 9 permission characters, describing 3 access types given
            to 3 user categories. The three access types are read ('r'), write ('w')
            and execute ('x'), and the three users categories are the user who owns
            the file, users in the group that the file belongs to and other users (the
            general public). An 'r', 'w' or 'x' character means the corresponding permission
            is present; a '-' means it is absent.
          </li>

          <li>
            <i>links</i> refers to the number of filesystem links pointing
            to the file/directory (see the discussion on hard/soft links in the next
            section).
          </li>

          <li>
            <i>owner</i> is usually the user who created the file or
            directory.
          </li>

          <li>
            <i>group</i> denotes a collection of users who are allowed
            to access the file according to the group access rights specified in the
            permissions field.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <i>size </i>is the length of a file, or the number of bytes
            used by the operating system to store the list of files in a directory.
          </li>

          <li>
            <i>date </i>is the date when the file or directory was last
            modified (written to). The <b>-u</b> option display the time when the
            file was last accessed (read).</li>

          <li>
            <i>name </i>is the name of the file or directory.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><br><b>ls</b> supports more options. To find out what
          they are, type:
        <p class="terminal">$ man ls</p>
        <p><b>man </b>is the online UNIX user manual, and you can
          use it to get help with commands and find out about what options are supported.
          It has quite a terse style which is often not that helpful, so some users
          prefer to the use the (non-standard) <b>info</b> utility if it is installed:
        <p class="terminal">$ info ls</p>
        <br>
        
        <li><b>cd</b> (change [current working] directory)</li>

        <p class="terminal"> $ cd <i>path</i></p>
        <p>changes your current working directory to <i>path</i>
          (which can be an absolute or a relative path). One of the most common relative
          paths to use is '..' (i.e. the parent directory of the current directory).
        <p>Used without any target directory
        <p class="terminal">$ cd</p>
        <p>resets your current working directory to your home directory
          (useful if you get lost). If you change into a directory and you subsequently
          want to return to your original directory, use
        <p class="terminal">$ cd -</p>
        <br>
        
        <li><b>mkdir</b> (make directory)</li>

        <p class="terminal">$ mkdir <i>directory</i></p>
        <p>creates a subdirectory called&nbsp; <i>directory</i>in
          the current working directory. You can only create subdirectories in a
          directory if you have write permission on that directory.</p>
        
        <li><b>rmdir </b>(remove directory)</li>

        <p class="terminal">$ rmdir <i>directory</i></p>
        <p>removes the subdirectory <i>directory</i> from the current
          working directory. You can only remove subdirectories if they are completely
          empty (i.e. of all entries besides the '.' and '..' directories).</p>

        <br>
        <li><b>cp</b> (copy)</li>

        <p><b>cp</b> is used to make copies of files or entire
          directories. To copy files, use:
        <p class="terminal">$ cp <i>source-file(s) destination</i></p>
        <p>where <i>source-file(s)</i> and <i>destination</i> specify
          the source and destination of the copy respectively. The behaviour of <b>cp</b>
          depends on whether the destination<i> </i>is a file or a directory. If
          the destination is a file, only one source file is allowed and <b>cp</b>
          makes a new file called <i>destination</i> that has the same contents as
          the source file. If the destination is a directory, many source files can
          be specified, each of which will be copied into the destination directory.
          Section 2.6 will discuss efficient specification of source files using
          wildcard characters.</p>
        <p>To copy entire directories (including their contents),
          use a <i>recursive</i> copy:
        <p class="terminal">$ cp -rd <i>source-directories destination-directory</i></p>

        <br>
        <li><b>mv</b> (move/rename)</li>

        <p><b>mv</b> is used to rename files/directories and/or
          move them from one directory into another. Exactly one source and one destination
          must be specified:
        <p class="terminal">$ mv <i>source destination</i></p>
        <p>If <i>destination</i> is an existing directory, the new
          name for <i>source</i> (whether it be a file or a directory) will&nbsp;
          be <i>destination<b>/</b>source</i>. If <i>source</i> and <i>destination</i>
          are both files, <i>source</i> is renamed <i>destination</i>. N.B.: if <i>destination</i>
          is an existing file it will be destroyed and overwritten by<i> source</i>
          (you can use the <b>-i</b> option if you would like to be asked for confirmation
          before a file is overwritten in this way).

          <br>
          <li><b>rm </b>(remove/delete)</li>

        <p class="terminal">$ rm <i>target-file(s)</i></p>
        <p>removes the specified files. Unlike other operating systems,
          it is almost impossible to recover a deleted file unless you have a backup
          (there is no recycle bin!) so use this command with care. If you would
          like to be asked before files are deleted, use the <b>-i </b>option:
        <p class="terminal">$ rm -i myfile
          <br>rm: remove 'myfile'?</p>
        <p><b>rm</b> can also be used to delete directories (along
          with all of their contents, including any subdirectories they contain).
          To do this, use the
          <b>-r</b> option. To avoid <b>rm</b> from asking
          any questions or giving errors (e.g. if the file doesn't exist) you used
          the <b>-f </b>(force) option. Extreme care needs to be taken when using
          this option - consider what would happen if a system administrator was
          trying to delete user<b> will</b>'s home directory and accidentally typed:
        <p class="terminal">$ rm -rf / home/will</p>
        <p>(instead of<b> rm -rf /home/will</b>).</p>
        
        <br>
        <li><b>cat</b> (catenate/type)</li>

        <p class="terminal">$ cat <i>target-file(s)</i></p>
        <p>displays the contents of <i>target-file(s)&nbsp;</i> on
          the screen, one after the other. You can also use it to create files from
          keyboard input as follows (<b>></b> is the output redirection operator,
          which will be discussed in the next chapter):
        <p class="terminal">
          $ cat > hello.txt
          <br>hello world!
          <br>[ctrl-d]
          <br>$ ls hello.txt
          <br>hello.txt
          <br>$ cat hello.txt
          <br>hello world!
          <br>$
        </p>

        <br>
        <li><b>more</b> and <b>less</b> (catenate with pause)</li>

        <p class="termnal">$ more <i>target-file(s)</i></p>
        <p>displays the contents of <i>target-file(s)&nbsp;</i> on
          the screen, pausing at the end of each screenful and asking the user to
          press a key (useful for long files). It also incorporates a searching facility
          (press '<b>/</b>' and then type a phrase that you want to look for).
        <p>You can also use <b>more</b> to break up the output
          of commands that produce more than one screenful of output as follows (<b>|
          </b>is
          the pipe operator, which will be discussed in the next chapter):
        <p class="terminal">$ ls -l | more</p>
        <p><b>less</b> is just like <b>more</b>, except that
          has a few extra features (such as allowing users to scroll backwards and
          forwards through the displayed file). <b>less</b> not a standard utility,
          however and may not be present on all UNIX systems.</p>

      </ul>

    <h2 id="s5">2.5 Making Hard and Soft (Symbolic) Links</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>Direct (hard) and indirect (soft or symbolic)
        links from one file or directory to another can be created using the <b>ln</b>
        command.
      <p class="terminal">$ ln <i>filename linkname</i></p>
      <p>creates another directory entry for <i>filename</i> called
        <i>linkname</i>(i.e. <i>linkname</i>
        is a hard link). Both directory entries appear identical (and both now
        have a link count of 2). If either <i>filename</i> or <i>linkname</i> is
        modified, the change will be reflected in the other file (since they are
        in fact just two different directory entries pointing to the same file).
      <p class="terminal">$ ln -s <i>filename linkname</i></p>
      <p>creates a shortcut called <i>linkname</i> (i.e. <i>linkname</i>
        is a soft link). The shortcut appears as an entry with a special type ('<b>l</b>'):
      <p class="terminal">$ ln -s hello.txt bye.txt
        <br>$ ls -l bye.txt
        <br>lrwxrwxrw 1 will finance 13 bye.txt -> hello.txt
        <br>$
      </p>
      <p>The link count of the source file remains unaffected.
        Notice that the permission bits on a symbolic link are not used (always
        appearing as <b>rwxrwxrwx</b>). Instead the permissions on the link are
        determined by the permissions on the target (<b>hello.txt</b> in this
        case).

      <p>Note that you can create a symbolic link to a file that
        doesn't exist, but not a hard link. Another difference between the two
        is that you can create symbolic links across different physical disk devices
        or partitions, but hard links are restricted to the same disk partition.
        Finally, most current UNIX implementations do not allow hard links to point
        to directories.</p>

    <h2 id="s6">2.6 Specifying multiple filenames</h2>


    <div class="text">

      <p>Multiple filenames can be specified using special
        pattern-matching characters. The rules are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>'<b>?</b>' matches any single character in that position
          in the filename.</li>
        
        <li>'<b>*</b>' matches zero or more characters in the filename.
          A '<b>*</b>' on its own will match all files. '<b>*.*</b>' matches
          all files with containing a '<b>.</b>'.</li>
        
        <li>Characters enclosed in square brackets ('[' and ']') will
          match any filename that has one of those characters in that position.</li>
        
        <li>A list of comma separated strings enclosed in curly braces
          ("{" and "}") will be expanded as a Cartesian product with the surrounding
          characters.</li>
        
        For example:
        <ol>
          <li><b>??? </b>matches all three-character filenames.</li>
          
          <li><b>?ell?</b> matches any five-character filenames with
            '<b>ell</b>' in the middle.</li>
          
          <li><b>he*</b> matches any filename beginning with '<b>he</b>'.</li>
          
          <li><b>[m-z]*[a-l]</b> matches any filename that begins with
            a letter from '<b>m</b>' to '<b>z</b>' and ends in a letter from '<b>a</b>'
            to '<b>l</b>'.</li>
          
          <li><b>{/usr,}{/bin,/lib}/file</b> expands to <b>/usr/bin/file
              /usr/lib/file /bin/file </b>and<b> /lib/file</b>.</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>

      <p>Note that the UNIX shell performs these expansions (including
        any filename matching) on a command's arguments <i>before</i> the command
        is executed.</p>

    <h2 id="s7">2.7 Quotes</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        As we have seen certain special characters (e.g.
        '<b>*</b>', '<b>-</b>','<b>{</b>' etc.) are interpreted in a special
        way by the shell. In order to pass arguments that use these characters
        to commands directly (i.e. without filename expansion etc.), we need to
        use special quoting characters. There are three levels of quoting that
        you can try:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Try insert a '<b>\</b>' in front of the special character.</li>
        <li>Use double quotes (<b>&quot;</b>) around arguments to prevent
          most expansions.</li>
        <li>Use single forward quotes (<b>'</b>) around arguments to
          prevent all expansions.</li>
      </ol>
      There is a fourth type of quoting in UNIX. Single backward
      quotes (<b>`</b>) are used to pass the output of some command as an input
      argument to another. For example:
      <p class="terminal">
        $ hostname
        <br>rose
        <br>$ echo this machine is called `hostname`
        <br>this machine is called rose
      </p>

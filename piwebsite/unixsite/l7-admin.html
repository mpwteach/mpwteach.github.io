    <div class="text">
      <p>This section covers basic system administration concepts and tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The superuser <b>root</b>.</li>

      <p>
        Note that you will not be given administrator access on
        the lab machines. However, you might like to try some basic administration
        tasks on your home computer.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>7.2 The Superuser root</h2>

    
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        The superuser is a privileged user who has unrestricted
        access to all commands and files on a system regardless of their permissions.
        The superuser's login is usually <b>root</b>. Access to the root account
        is restricted by a password (the root password). Because the root account
        has huge potential for destruction, the root password should be chosen
        carefully, only given to those who need it, and changed regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to become <b>root </b>is to log in as usual
        using the username <b>root</b> and the root password (usually security
        measures are in place so that this is only possible if you are using a
        "secure" console and not connecting over a network). Using <b>root</b>
        as your default login in this way is not recommended, however, because
        normal safeguards that apply to other user accounts do not apply to <b>root</b>.
        Consequently using <b>root</b> for mundane tasks often results in a memory
        lapse or misplaced keystrokes having catastrophic effects (e.g. forgetting
        for a moment which directory you are in and accidentally deleting another
        user's files, or accidentally typing "<b>rm -rf * .txt</b>" instead of
        "<b>rm -rf *.txt</b>" ).
      </p>
      <p>
        A better way to become root is to use the <b>su</b>
        utility. <b>su</b> (switch user) lets you become another user (at least
        as far as the computer is concerned). If you don't specify the name of
        the user you wish to become, the system will assume you want to become
        <b>root</b>.
        Using <b>su</b> does not usually change your current directory, unless
        you specify a "<b>-</b>" option which will run the target user's startup
        scripts and change into their home directory (provided you can supply the
        right password of course). So:
        <div class="terminal">
          $ su -<br>
          Password: xxxxxxxx<br>
          #
        </div>
      <p>
        Note that the root account often displays a different
        prompt (usually a <b>#</b>). To return to your old self, simply type
        "<b>exit</b>" at the shell prompt.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should avoid leaving a root window open while you
        are not at your machine. Consider this paragraph from a humorous 1986 Computer
        Language article by Alan Filipski:
      </p>
      <p>
        "The prudent administrator should be aware of common techniques
        used to breach UNIX security. The most widely known and practised attack
        on the security of the UNIX brand operating system is elegant in its simplicity.
        The perpetrator simply hangs around the system console until the operator
        leaves to get a drink or go to the bathroom. The intruder lunges for the
        console and types <b>rm -rf /</b> before anyone can pry his or her hands
        off the keyboard. Amateur efforts are characterised by typing in things
        such as <b>ls</b> or <b>pwd</b>. A skilled UNIX brand operating system
        security expert would laugh at such attempts."
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>7.3 Shutdown and System Start-up</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <ul>
        <li>Shutdown: <b>shutdown, halt</b>, <b>reboot </b>(in <b>/sbin</b>)</li>

        <p>
          <b>/sbin/shutdown </b>allows a UNIX system to shut
          down gracefully and securely. All logged-in users are
          notified that the system is going down, and new logins are
          blocked. It is possible to shut the system down immediately
          or after a specified delay and to specify what should happen after the
          system has been shut down:
          <div class="terminal">
            # /sbin/shutdown -r now    (shutdown now and reboot)<br>
            # /sbin/shutdown -h +5     (shut down in 5 minutes and halt)<br>
            # /sbin/shutdown -k 17:00  (fake a shutdown at 5pm)
          </div>
        <p>
          <b>halt</b> and <b>reboot</b> are equivalent to <b>shutdown -h</b>
          and <b>shutdown -r</b> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have to shut a system down extremely urgently or
          for some reason cannot use <b>shutdown</b>, it is at least a good idea
          to first run the command:
          <div class="terminal">
            # sync
          </div>
        <p>
          which forces the state of the file system to be brought up to date.
        </p>

        <li>System startup:</li>

        <p>
          At system startup, the operating system performs various
          low-level tasks, such as initialising the memory system, loading up device
          drivers to communicate with hardware devices, mounting filesystems and
          creating the <b>init</b> process (the parent of all processes). <b>init</b>'s
          primary responsibility is to start up the system services as specified
          in <b>/etc/inittab</b>. Typically these services include gettys (i.e.
          virtual terminals where users can login), and the scripts in the directory
          <b>/etc/rc.d/init.d</b> which usually spawn high-level daemons such as
          <b>httpd</b> (the web server). On most UNIX systems you can type <b>dmesg</b> to see system
          startup messages, or look in <b>/var/log/messages</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a mounted filesystem is not "clean" (e.g. the machine
          was turned off without shutting down properly), a system utility <b>fsck</b> is
          automatically run to repair it. Automatic running can only fix certain
          errors, however, and you may have to run it manually:
          <div class="terminal">
            # fsck <i>filesys</i>
          </div>
        <p>
          where <i>filesys</i> is the name of a device (e.g.<b>
            /dev/hda1</b>) or a mount point (like <b>/</b>). "Lost" files recovered
          during this process end up in the <b>lost+found</b> directory. Some more
          modern filesystems called "journaling" file systems don't require <b>fsck</b>,
          since they keep extensive logs of filesystem events and are able to recover
          in a similar way to a transactional database.
        </p>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>7.4 Adding Users</h2>
    
    <div class="text">
      
      <ul>
        <li><b>useradd</b> (in <b>/usr/sbin</b>):</li>

        <p>
          <b>useradd</b> is a utility for adding new users
          to a UNIX system. It adds new user information to the <b>/etc/passwd</b>
          file and creates a new home directory for the user. When you add a new
          user, you should also set their password (using the <b>-p</b> option
          on <b>useradd</b>, or using the <b>passwd</b> utility):
          <div class="terminal">
            # useradd bob<br>
            # passwd bob
          </div>
        </p>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <h2>7.5 Controlling User Groups</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <ul>
        <li><b>groupadd</b> (in <b>/usr/sbin</b>):</li>
        <p>
          <b>groupadd</b> creates a new user group and adds
          the new information to <b>/etc/group</b>:
          <div class="terminal">
            # groupadd <i>groupname</i>
          </div>
        </p>
	
        <li><b>usermod</b> (in <b>/usr/sbin</b>):</li>
        <p>
          Every user belongs to a primary group and possibly
          also to a set of supplementary groups. To modify the group permissions
          of an existing user, use:
          <div class="terminal">
            # usermod -g <i>initialgroup username</i> -G <i>othergroups</i>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          where <i>othergroups </i>is a list of supplementary group
          names separated by commas (with no intervening whitespace).
        </p>

        <li><b>groups</b></li>
        <p>
          You can find out which groups a user belongs to by
          typing:
          <div class="terminal">
            # groups <i>username</i>
          </div>
        </p>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>7.6 Reconfiguring and Recompiling the Linux Kernel</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Linux has a modular, customisable kernel with
        several switchable options (e.g. support for multiple processors and device
        drivers for various hardware devices). It may happen that some new hardware
        is added to a Linux machine which requires you to recompile the kernel
        so that it includes device driver support (and possibly new system calls)
        for the new hardware. To do this, you will need to rebuild the Linux kernel
        from scratch as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Look in <b>/usr/src/linux</b> for the kernel source code.
          If it isn't there (or if there is just a message saying that only kernel
          binaries have been installed), get hold of a copy of the latest kernel
          source code from <a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a>
          and untar it into <b>/usr/src/linux</b>.
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <li>Change directory to <b>/usr/src/linux</b>.</li>
        <p></p>

        <li>To configure the kernel type either</li>
        <p>
          <div class="terminal">
            # make config      (simple text mode configuration), or<br>
            # make menuconfig  (menu-driven text configuration), or<br>
            # make xconfig     (graphical configuration for X)
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be asked to select which modules (device drivers,
          multiprocessor support etc.) you wish to include. For each module, you
          can chose to include it in the kernel code (<b>y</b>), incorporate it
          as an optional module that will be loaded if needed (<b>m</b>) or to
          exclude it from the kernel code (<b>n</b>). To find out which optional
          modules have actually been loaded you can run <b>lsmod</b> when the system
          reboots.
        </p>

        <li>Now type:</li>

        <p>
          <div class="terminal">
            # make dep     (to build source code dependencies)<br>
            # make clean   (to delete all stale object files)<br>
            # make bzImage (to build the new kernel)<br>
            # make modules (to build the new optional modules)<br>
            # make modules_install (to install the modules)
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          The file <b>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage</b>
          now contains your new kernel image. It remains only to install it.
        </p>

        <li>
          Change directory to <b>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot</b>.
          In the same directory should be a script called <b>install.sh</b> which
          will copy your kernel image into <b>/boot/vmlinuz</b>:
        </li>

        <p>
          <div class="terminal">
            # install.sh <i>version</i> bzImage /boot/System.map/boot
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          where <i>version</i> is the kernel version number (of
          form 2.2.xx).
        </p>

        <li>
          Finally, you may need to update the <b>/etc/lilo.conf</b>
          file so that <b>lilo</b> (the Linux boot loader) includes an entry for
          your new kernel. Then run
        </li>

        <p>
          <div class="terminal">
            # lilo
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          to update the changes. When you reboot your machine, you
          should be able to select your new kernel image from the <b>lilo</b> boot
          loader.
        </p>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>7.7 Cron Jobs</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        <b>crond</b> is a daemon that executes commands
        that need to be run regularly according to some schedule. The schedule
        and corresponding commands are stored in the file <b>/etc/crontab</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each entry in the <b>/etc/crontab</b> file entry contains
        six fields separated by spaces or tabs in the following form:
      </p>
      <p><i>minute hour day_of_month month weekday command</i></p>
      <p>
        These fields accept the following values:
      </p>
      <p><i>minute</i>: 0 through 59</p>
      <p><i>hour</i>: 0 through 23</p>
      <p><i>day_of_month</i>: 1 through 31</p>
      <p><i>month</i>: 1 through 12</p>
      <p><i>weekday</i>: 0 (Sun) through 6 (Sat)</p>
      <p><i>command</i>: a shell command</p>
      <p>
        You must specify a value for each field. Except for the
        command field, these fields can contain the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A number in the specified range, e.g. to run a command in
            May, specify 5 in the <i>month</i> field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two numbers separated by a dash to indicate an inclusive
            range, e.g. to run a cron job on Tuesday through Friday, place 2-5 in the
            <i>weekday</i>
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            A list of numbers separated by commas, e.g. to run a command
            on the first and last day of January, you would specify 1,31 in the <i>day_of_month</i>
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>*</b> (asterisk), meaning all allowed values, e.g. to
            run a job every hour, specify an asterisk in the <i>hour</i> field.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also specify some execution environment options at
        the top of the <b>/etc/crontab</b> file:
        <div class="codeeg">
          SHELL=/bin/bash</br>
          PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</br>
          MAILTO=root
        </div>
      <p>
        To run the calendar command at 6:30am. every Mon, Wed,
        and Fri, a suitable <b>/etc/crontab</b> entry would be:
        <div class="codeeg">
          30 6 * * 1,3,5 /usr/bin/calendar
        </div>
      <p>
        The output of the command will be mailed to the user specified
        in the <b>MAILTO</b> environment option.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't need to restart the cron daemon <b>crond</b>
        after changing <b>/etc/crontab</b> - it automatically detects changes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>7.8 Keeping Essential Processes Alive</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        It is important that daemons related to mission
        critical services are immediately respawned if they fail for some reason.
        You can do this by adding your own entries to the <b>/etc/inittab</b>
        file. For example:
        <div class="codeeg">
          rs:2345:respawn:/home/sms/server/RingToneServer
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here <b>rs</b> is a 2 character code identifying the
        service, and <b>2345</b> are the runlevels (to find about runlevels,
        type <b>man runlevel</b>) for which the process should be created. The
        <b>init</b> process will create the <b>RingToneServer</b> process at system
        startup, and respawn it should it die for any reason.
      </p>
    </div>

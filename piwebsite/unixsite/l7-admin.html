    <h2>7.2 The Superuser root</h2>

    
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        The superuser is a privileged user who has unrestricted
        access to all commands and files on a system regardless of their permissions.
        The superuser's login is usually <b>root</b>. Access to the root account
        is restricted by a password (the root password). Because the root account
        has huge potential for destruction, the root password should be chosen
        carefully, only given to those who need it, and changed regularly.
      <p>One way to become <b>root </b>is to log in as usual
        using the username <b>root</b> and the root password (usually security
measures are in place so that this is only possible if you are using a
"secure" console and not connecting over a network). Using <b>root</b>
as your default login in this way is not recommended, however, because
normal safeguards that apply to other user accounts do not apply to <b>root</b>.
Consequently using <b>root</b> for mundane tasks often results in a memory
lapse or misplaced keystrokes having catastrophic effects (e.g. forgetting
for a moment which directory you are in and accidentally deleting another
user's files, or accidentally typing "<b>rm -rf * .txt</b>" instead of
"<b>rm -rf *.txt</b>" ).
<p>A better way to become root is to use the <b>su</b>
utility. <b>su</b> (switch user) lets you become another user (at least
as far as the computer is concerned). If you don't specify the name of
the user you wish to become, the system will assume you want to become
<b>root</b>.
Using <b>su</b> does not usually change your current directory, unless
you specify a "<b>-</b>" option which will run the target user's startup
scripts and change into their home directory (provided you can supply the
right password of course). So:
<p><b> $ su -</b><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><b> Password: xxxxxxxx</b><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<br><b> #</b>
<p>Note that the root account often displays a different
prompt (usually a <b>#</b>). To return to your old self, simply type
"<b>exit</b>" at the shell prompt.
<p>You should avoid leaving a root window open while you
are not at your machine. Consider this paragraph from a humorous 1986 Computer
Language article by Alan Filipski:
<p>"The prudent administrator should be aware of common techniques
used to breach UNIX security. The most widely known and practised attack
on the security of the UNIX brand operating system is elegant in its simplicity.
The perpetrator simply hangs around the system console until the operator
leaves to get a drink or go to the bathroom. The intruder lunges for the
console and types <b>rm -rf /</b> before anyone can pry his or her hands
off the keyboard. Amateur efforts are characterised by typing in things
such as <b>ls</b> or <b>pwd</b>. A skilled UNIX brand operating system
security expert would laugh at such attempts."</blockquote>

7.3 Shutdown and System Start-up
</div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Shutdown<b>: shutdown, halt</b>, <b>reboot </b>(in<b>
/sbin</b>)</li>

<p><br><b>/sbin/shutdown </b>allows a UNIX system to shut
down gracefully and securely. All logged-in users are
notified that the system is going down, and new logins are
blocked. It is possible to shut the system down immediately
or after a specified delay and to specify what should happen after the
system has been shut down:
<p><b># /sbin/shutdown -r now<img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27></b>(shut
down now and reboot)
<br><b># /sbin/shutdown -h +5<img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>

</b>(shut down in 5 minutes &amp; halt)
<br><b># /sbin/shutdown -k 17:00<img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27></b>(fake
a shutdown at 5pm)
<p><b>halt </b>and<b> reboot </b>are equivalent to<b>
shutdown -h </b>and<b> shutdown -r </b>respectively.
<p>If you have to shut a system down extremely urgently or
for some reason cannot use <b>shutdown</b>, it is at least a good idea
to first run the command:
<p><b> # sync</b><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>which forces the state of the file system to be brought
up to date.
<br>
<li>
System startup:</li>

<p>At system startup, the operating system performs various
low-level tasks, such as initialising the memory system, loading up device
drivers to communicate with hardware devices, mounting filesystems and
creating the <b>init</b> process (the parent of all processes). <b>init</b>'s
primary responsibility is to start up the system services as specified
in <b>/etc/inittab</b>. Typically these services include gettys (i.e.
virtual terminals where users can login), and the scripts in the directory
<b>/etc/rc.d/init.d</b>
which usually spawn high-level daemons such as
<b>httpd</b> (the web
server). On most UNIX systems you can type <b>dmesg</b> to see system
startup messages, or look in <b>/var/log/messages</b>.
<p>If a mounted filesystem is not "clean" (e.g. the machine
was turned off without shutting down properly), a system utility <b>fsck
</b>is
automatically run to repair it. Automatic running can only fix certain
errors, however, and you may have to run it manually:
<p><b> # fsck </b><i>filesys</i><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>where <i>filesys</i> is the name of a device (e.g.<b>
/dev/hda1</b>) or a mount point (like <b>/</b>). "Lost" files recovered
during this process end up in the <b>lost+found</b> directory. Some more
modern filesystems called "journaling" file systems don't require <b>fsck</b>,
since they keep extensive logs of filesystem events and are able to recover
in a similar way to a transactional database.</ul>

user, you should also set their password (using the <b>-p</b> option

7.6 Reconfiguring and Recompiling the Linux Kernel
</div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="text">
<blockquote>Linux has a modular, customisable kernel with
several switchable options (e.g. support for multiple processors and device
drivers for various hardware devices). It may happen that some new hardware
is added to a Linux machine which requires you to recompile the kernel
so that it includes device driver support (and possibly new system calls)
for the new hardware. To do this, you will need to rebuild the Linux kernel
from scratch as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Look in <b>/usr/src/linux</b> for the kernel source code.
If it isn't there (or if there is just a message saying that only kernel
binaries have been installed), get hold of a copy of the latest kernel
source code from <a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a>
and untar it into <b>/usr/src/linux</b>.</li>

<p>
<li>
Change directory to <b>/usr/src/linux</b>.</li>
<p>
<li> To configure the kernel type either</li>

<p><b> # make config
</b>(simple text mode configuration), or
<br><b> # make menuconfig </b>(menu-driven
text configuration), or
<br><b> # make xconfig </b>(graphical
configuration for X)
<p>You will be asked to select which modules (device drivers,
multiprocessor support etc.) you wish to include. For each module, you
can chose to include it in the kernel code (<b>y</b>), incorporate it
as an optional module that will be loaded if needed (<b>m</b>) or to
exclude it from the kernel code (<b>n</b>). To find out which optional
modules have actually been loaded you can run <b>lsmod</b> when the system
reboots.
<br>
<li>
Now type:</li>

<p><b> # make dep
</b>(to build source code dependencies)
<br><b> # make clean </b>(to
delete all stale object files)
<br><b> # make bzImage </b>(to build
the new kernel)
<br><b> # make modules </b>(to build
the new optional modules)
<br><b> # make modules_install </b>(to
install the modules)
<p>The file <b>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage</b>
now contains your new kernel image. It remains only to install it.
<br>
<li>
Change directory to <b>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot</b>.
In the same directory should be a script called <b>install.sh</b> which
will copy your kernel image into <b>/boot/vmlinuz</b>:</li>

<p><b># install.sh </b><i>version</i><b> bzImage /boot/System.map
/boot</b>
<p>where <i>version</i> is the kernel version number (of
form 2.2.xx).
<br>
<li>
Finally, you may need to update the <b>/etc/lilo.conf</b>
file so that <b>lilo</b> (the Linux boot loader) includes an entry for
your new kernel. Then run</li>

<p><b> # lilo</b><img SRC="enter.gif" height=15 width=27>
<p>to update the changes. When you reboot your machine, you
should be able to select your new kernel image from the <b>lilo</b> boot
loader.</ul>

7.7 Cron Jobs
</div>
</div>
<br>

<div class="text">
<blockquote><b>crond</b> is a daemon that executes commands
that need to be run regularly according to some schedule. The schedule
and corresponding commands are stored in the file <b>/etc/crontab</b>.
<p>Each entry in the <b>/etc/crontab</b> file entry contains
six fields separated by spaces or tabs in the following form:
<p><i>minute
hour day_of_month month weekday command</i>
<p>These fields accept the following values:
<p><b>minute
0 through 59</b>
<br><b> hour
0 through 23</b>
<br><b> day_of_month
1 through 31</b>
<br><b> month
1 through 12</b>
<br><b> weekday
0 (Sun) through 6 (Sat)</b>
<br><b> command
a shell command</b>
<p>You must specify a value for each field. Except for the
command field, these fields can contain the following:
<ul>
<li>
A number in the specified range, e.g. to run a command in
May, specify 5 in the <i>month</i> field.</li>

<li>
Two numbers separated by a dash to indicate an inclusive
range, e.g. to run a cron job on Tuesday through Friday, place 2-5 in the
<i>weekday</i>
field.</li>

<li>
A list of numbers separated by commas, e.g. to run a command
on the first and last day of January, you would specify 1,31 in the <i>day_of_month</i>
field.</li>

<li>
<b>*</b> (asterisk), meaning all allowed values, e.g. to
run a job every hour, specify an asterisk in the <i>hour</i> field.</li>
</ul>
You can also specify some execution environment options at
the top of the <b>/etc/crontab</b> file:
<p><b>SHELL=/bin/bash</b>
<br><b>PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</b>
<br><b>MAILTO=root</b>
<p>To run the calendar command at 6:30am. every Mon, Wed,
and Fri, a suitable <b>/etc/crontab</b> entry would be:
<p><b>30 6 * * 1,3,5 /usr/bin/calendar</b>
<p>The output of the command will be mailed to the user specified
in the <b>MAILTO</b> environment option.
<p>You don't need to restart the cron daemon <b>crond</b>
after changing
<b>/etc/crontab</b> - it automatically detects changes.</blockquote>

7.8 Keeping Essential Processes Alive
</div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="text">
<blockquote>It is important that daemons related to mission
critical services are immediately respawned if they fail for some reason.
You can do this by adding your own entries to the <b>/etc/inittab</b>
file. For example:
<p><b>rs:2345:respawn:/home/sms/server/RingToneServer</b>
<p>Here <b>rs</b> is a 2 character code identifying the
service, and
<b>2345</b> are the runlevels (to find about runlevels,
type <b>man runlevel</b>) for which the process should be created. The<b>
init </b>process will create the <b>RingToneServer</b> process at system
startup, and respawn it should it die for any reason.</blockquote>

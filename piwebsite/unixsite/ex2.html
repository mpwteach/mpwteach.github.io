    <h2>UNIX: Exercise Sheet 2</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <ol>
        <li>
          Try the following command sequence:
	</li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>cd</b></li>

          <li><b>pwd</b></li>

          <li><b>ls -al</b></li>

          <li><b>cd .</b></li>

          <li><b>pwd</b> (where did that get you?)</li>

          <li><b>cd ..</b></li>

          <li><b>pwd</b></li>

          <li><b>ls -al</b></li>

          <li><b>cd ..</b></li>

          <li><b>pwd</b></li>

          <li><b>ls -al</b></li>

          <li><b>cd ..</b></li>

          <li><b>pwd</b> (what happens now)</li>

          <li><b>cd /etc</b></li>

          <li><b>ls -al | more</b></li>

          <li><b>cat passwd</b></li>

          <li><b>cd -</b></li>

          <li><b>pwd</b></li>
        </ul>

        <li>
          Continue to explore the filesystem tree using <b>cd</b>,
          <b>ls</b>, <b>pwd</b> and <b>cat</b>. Look in <b>/bin</b>, <b>/usr/bin</b>,
          <b>/sbin</b>, <b>/tmp</b> and <b>/boot</b>. What do you see?
	</li>

        <li>
          Explore <b>/dev</b>. Can you identify what devices are
          available? Which are character-oriented and which are block-oriented?
          Can you identify your by (terminal) device (typing <b>who am
            i </b>might help); who is the owner of your by (use <b>ls -l</b>)?
	</li>

        <li>
          Explore <b>/proc</b>. Display the contents of the files
          <b>interrupts</b>, <b>devices</b>, <b>cpuinfo</b>, <b>meminfo</b>
          and <b>uptime</b> using <b>cat</b>. Can you see why we say <b>/proc</b>
          is a pseudo-filesystem which allows access to kernel data structures?
	</li>

        <li>
          Change to the home directory of another user directly, using
          <b>cd ~username</b>.
	</li>

        <li>
          Change back into your home directory.</li>

        <li>
          Make subdirectories called <b>work</b> and <b>play</b>.
	</li>

        <li>
          Delete the subdirectory called <b>work</b>.
	</li>

        <li>
          Copy the file <b>/etc/passwd</b> into your home directory.</li>

        <li>
          Move it into the subdirectory <b>play</b>.
	</li>

        <li>
          Change into subdirectory <b>play</b> and create a symbolic
          link called <b>terminal</b> that points to your by device. What happens
          if you try to make a hard link to the by device?
	</li>

        <li>
          What is the difference between listing the contents of directory
          play with <b>ls -l</b> and <b>ls -L</b>?
	</li>

        <li>
          Create a file called <b>hello.txt</b> that contains the
          words <q>hello world</q>. Can you use <b>cp</b> using <b>terminal</b>
          as the source file to achieve the same effect?
	</li>

        <li>
          Copy <b>hello.txt</b> to <b>terminal</b>. What happens?
	</li>

        <li>
          Imagine you were working on a system and someone accidentally
          deleted the <b>ls</b> command (<b>/bin/ls</b>). How could you get a
          list of the files in the current directory? Try it.
	</li>

        <li>
          How would you create and then delete a file called <q><b>$SHELL</b><q>?
          Try it.
	</li>

        <li>
          How would you create and then delete a file that begins with
          the symbol <b>#</b>? Try it.
	</li>

        <li>
          How would you create and then delete a file that begins with
          the symbol <b>-</b>? Try it.
	</li>

        <li>
          What is the output of the command: <b>echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}</b>?
          Now, from your home directory, copy <b>/etc/passwd</b> and <b>/etc/group</b>
          into your home directory in one command given that you can only type <b>/etc</b>
          once.
	</li>

        <li>
          Still in your home directory, copy the entire directory <b>play</b>
          to a directory called <b>work</b>, preserving the symbolic link.
	</li>

        <li>
          Delete the <b>work</b> directory and its contents with
          one command. Accept no complaints or queries.
	</li>

        <li>
          Change into a directory that does not belong to you and try
          to delete all the files (avoid <b>/proc</b> or <b>/dev</b>, just in
          case!)
	</li>

        <li>
          Experiment with the options on the <b>ls</b> command. What
          do the <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>R</b> and <b>F</b> options do?
	</li>
      </ol>

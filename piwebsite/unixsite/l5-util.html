    <h2>5.2 Connecting to Remote Machines</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <ul>
        <li><b>ssh</b> <i>machinename</i></li>

        <p>
	  <b>ssh</b> is a secure alternative for remote login
          and also for executing commands in a remote machine. It is intended to
          replace <b>rlogin</b> and <b>rsh</b>, and provide secure encrypted
          communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11
          connections (i.e. graphics) can also be forwarded over the secure channel
          (another advantage over <b>telnet</b>, <b>rlogin</b> and <b>rsh</b>).
          <b>ssh</b> is not a standard system utility, although it is a de facto standard.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To login to a remote machine with your current user name:
	  <div class="terminal">
	    $ ssh <i>hostname</i>
	  </div>
	</p>
	<p>
	  To login to a remote machine with a different user name:
	  <div class="terminal">
	    $ ssh <i>username</i>@<i>hostname</i>
	  </div>
	</p>
        <p>
	  <b>ssh</b> clients are also available for Windows machines
          (e.g. there is a good <b>ssh</b> client called <b>putty</b>).
	</p>
      </ul>
      
    </div>

    <h2>5.3 Network routing utilities</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <ul>
        <li><b>ping</b> <i>machinename</i></li>

        <p>
	  The <b>ping</b> utility is useful for checking round-trip
          response time between machines. e.g.
          <div class="terminal">
	    $ ping www.google.com
	  </div>
	</p>
        <p>
	  measures the reponse time delay between the current machine
          and the web server at Google.
          <b>ping</b> is also useful to check whether a machine is still "alive" in
          some sense.
	</p>

        <li><b>traceroute</b> <i>machinename</i></li>
	
        <p>
	  <b>traceroute</b> shows the full path taken to reach
          a remote machine, including the delay to each machine along the route.
          This is particularly useful in tracking down the location of network problems.
	</p>
      </ul>
    </div>
      
    <h2>5.4 Remote File Transfer</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <ul>
        <li><b>ftp</b> <i>machinename</i> (file transfer protocol)</li>

        <p>
	  <b>ftp</b> is an insecure way of transferring files
          between computers. When you connect to a machine via ftp, you will be asked
          for your username and password. If you have an account on the machine,
          you can use it, or you can can often use the user "<b>ftp</b>" or "<b>anonymous</b>".
          Once logged in via FTP, you can list files (<b>dir</b>), receive files
          (<b>get</b> and <b>mget</b>) and send files (<b>put</b> and <b>mput</b>).
          (Unusually for UNIX) <b>help</b> will show you a list of available commands.
          Particularly useful are <b>binary</b> (transfer files preserving all
          8 bits) and <b>prompt n</b> (do not confirm each file on multiple file
          transfers). Type <b>quit</b> to leave <b>ftp</b> and return to the
          shell prompt.
	</p>

        <li><b>scp</b> <i>sourcefiles destination</i> (secure copy)</li>

        <p>
	  <b>scp</b> is an ssh tool which provides a secure way of transferring files between
          computers. It works just like the UNIX <b>cp</b> command except that
          the arguments can specify a user and remote machine as well as files. For example:
          <div class="terminal"> 
	    $ scp jon@srv.ucla.edu:~/hello.txt .
          </div>
	</p>
        <p>
	  will (subject to correct authentication) copy the file <b>hello.txt</b>
          from the user account <b>jon</b> on the remote machine
          <b>srv.ucla.edu</b> into the current directory (<b>.</b>) on the local machine.
	</p>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>5.5 Other Internet-related utilities</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <ul>

        <li><b>wget</b> <i>URL</i></li>

        <p>
	  <b>wget</b> provides a way to retrieve files from the
          web (using the HTTP protocol). <b>wget</b> is non-interactive,
          which means it can run in the background, while the user is not logged
          in (unlike most web browsers). The content retrieved by <b>wget</b>
          is stored as raw HTML text (which can be viewed later using a web browser).
	</p>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>5.6 User Information and Communication</h2>
  
    <div class="text">

      <ul>
        <li><b>finger</b>, <b>who</b></li>

        <p>
	  <b>finger</b> and <b>who</b> show the list of users logged into a machine, 
	  the terminal they are using, and the date they logged in on.
          <div class="terminal">
	    $ who<br>
            jon pts/2  Dec  5 19:41<br>
            $
          </div>
	</p>
          
        <li><b>write</b>, <b>talk</b></li>

        <p>
	  <b>write</b> is used by users on the same machine who
          want to talk to each other. You should specify the user and (optionally)
          the terminal they are on:
          <div class="terminal">
	    $ write will pts/2<br>
            hello jon
          </div>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Lines are only transmitted when you press return.
	  To return to the shell prompt, press ctrl-d (the UNIX end of file marker).
	</p>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>5.9 Advanced Text File Processing</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>sed </b>(stream editor)</li>

      <p>
	<b>sed</b> allows you to perform basic text transformations
	on an input stream (i.e. a file or input from a pipeline). For example,
	you can delete lines containing particular string of text, or you can substitute
	one pattern for another wherever it occurs in a file. Although <b>sed</b> is
	a mini-programming language all on its own and can execute entire scripts,
	its full language is obscure and probably best forgotten (being based on
	the old and esoteric UNIX line editor <b>ed</b>). <b>sed</b> is probably
	at its most useful when used directly from the command line with simple
	parameters:
      <p><b>$ sed "s/</b><i>pattern1</i><b>/</b><i>pattern2</i><b>/"
	</b><i>inputfile</i><b>
	  > </b><i>outputfile</i>
	<br>(substitutes <i>pattern2</i> for <i>pattern1</i> once
	per line)
      <p><b>$ sed "s/</b><i>pattern1</i>/<i>pattern2</i><b>/g"
	</b><i>inputfile</i><b>
	  > </b><i>outputfile</i>
	<br>(substitutes <i>pattern2</i> for <i>pattern1</i> for
every <i>pattern1</i> per line)
<p><b>$ sed "/</b><i>pattern1</i><b>/d" </b><i>inputfile</i><b>
    > </b><i>outputfile</i>
<br>(deletes all lines containing <i>pattern1</i>)
<p><b>$ sed "y/</b><i>string1</i><b>/</b><i>string2</i><b>/"
  </b><i>inputfile</i><b>
    > </b><i>outputfile</i>
<br>(substitutes characters in <i>string2</i> for those in
<i>string1</i>)
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>awk</b> (Aho, Weinberger and Kernigan)</li>

<p><b>awk</b> is useful for manipulating files that contain
  columns of data on a line by line basis. Like <b>sed</b>, you can either
  pass <b>awk</b> statements directly on the command line, or you can write
  a script file and let <b>awk</b> read the commands from the script.
<p>Say we have a file of cricket scores called <b>cricket.dat</b>
  containing columns for player number, name, runs and the way in which they
  were dismissed:
<p><b>1 atherton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; bowled
<br><b>2 hussain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;
  caught
<br><b>3 stewart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 47&nbsp;&nbsp;
  stumped
<br><b>4 thorpe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33&nbsp;&nbsp;
  lbw
<br><b>5 gough&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  6&nbsp;&nbsp; run-out
<p>To print out only the first and second columns we can say:
<p><b>$ awk '{ print $1 " " $2 }' cricket.dat
<br><b>atherton 0
<br><b>hussain 20
<br><b>stewart 47
<br><b>thorpe 33
<br><b>gough 6
<br><b>$
<p>Here <b>$</b><i>n</i> stands for the <i>n</i>th field
  or column of each line in the data file. <b>$0 </b>can be used to denote
  the whole line.
<p>We can do much more with <b>awk</b>. For example, we
  can write a script <b>cricket.awk</b> to calculate the team's batting
  average and to check if Mike Atherton got another duck:
<p><b>$ cat > cricket.awk
<br><b>BEGIN { players = 0; runs = 0 }
<br><b>{ players++; runs +=$3 }
<br><b>/atherton/ { if (runs==0) print "atherton duck!"
  }
<br><b>END { print "the batting average is " runs/players
  }
<br>(ctrl-d)
<br>$ <b>awk -f cricket.awk cricket.dat</b>
<br><b>atherton duck!
<br><b>the batting average is 21.2
<br><b>$
<p>The <b>BEGIN</b> clause is executed once at the start
  of the script, the main clause once for every line, the <b>/atherton/
  </b>clause
  only if the word <b>atherton </b>occurs in the line and the
  <b>END</b>
  clause once at the end of the script.
<p><b>awk</b> can do a lot more. See the manual pages for
  details (type <b>man awk</b>).</ul>

<h2>5.10 Target Directed Compilation</h2>
 <div class="text">
   <ul><li><b>make</b></li>

     <p>
       <b>make</b> is a utility which can determine automatically
       which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands&nbsp;
       to recompile them. To use make, you need to create a file called <b>Makefile</b>
       or <b>makefile</b> that describes&nbsp; the relationships among files
       in your program, and the states the commands for updating each file.
     <p>Here is an example of a simple makefile:
     <p><b>scores.out: cricket.awk cricket.dat
	 <br>[TAB]<b>awk -f cricket.awk cricket.dat > scores.out</b>
<p>Here [TAB] indicates the TAB key. The interpretation of
  this makefile is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>scores.out</b> is the target of the compilation</li>

<li>
  <b>scores.out</b> depends on <b>cricket.awk</b> and <b>cricket.dat</b></li>

<li>
  if either <b>cricket.awk</b> or <b>cricket.dat</b> have
  been modified since <b>scores.out </b>was last modified or if <b>scores.out</b>
  does not exist, update <b>scores.out</b> by executing the command:</li>

<br><b>awk -f cricket.awk cricket.dat > scores.out<br>
</ul>
<b>make</b> is invoked simply by typing
<p><b>$ make
<br><b>awk -f cricket.awk cricket.dat > scores.out
<br><b>$
<p>Since <b>scores.out</b> did not exist, <b>make</b>
  executed the commands to create it. If we now invoke make again, nothing
  happens:
<p><b>$ make
<br><b>make: `scores.out' is up to date.
<br><b>$
<p>But if we modify <b>cricket.dat</b> and then run <b>make</b>
  again, <b>scores.out</b> will be updated:
<p><b>$ touch cricket.dat</b>(<b>touch
  </b>simulates
  file modification)
<br><b>$ make
<br><b>awk -f cricket.awk cricket.dat > scores.out
<br><b>$
<p><b>make</b> is mostly used when compiling large C, C++
  or Java programs, but can (as we have seen) be used to automatically and
  intelligently produce a target file of any kind.</ul>

<h2>5.11 Version control with CVS</h2>
 
<div class="text">

      <p>
	<b>cvs</b> (Concurrent Versioning System) is a source code control system often used
	on large programming projects to control the concurrent editing of source
	files by multiple authors. It keeps old versions of files and maintains
	a log of when, and why changes occurred, and who made them.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>cvs</b> keeps a single copy of the master sources.
	This copy is called the source ``repository''; it contains all the
	information to permit extracting previous software releases at any time
	based on either a symbolic revision tag, or a date in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>cvs</b> has a large number of commands (type <b>info cvs</b> 
	for a full <b>cvs</b> tutorial, including how to set up a repository
	from scratch or from existing code). The most useful commands are:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li><b>cvs checkout</b> <i>modules</i></li>
	<p>
	  This gives you a private copy of source code that you can work on with
	  without interfering with others.
	</p>

	<li><b>cvs update</b></li>
	<p>
	  This updates the code you have checked out, to reflect any changes
	  that have subsequently been made by other developers.
	</p>
	
	<li><b>cvs add</b> <i>files</i></li>
	<p>
	  You can use this to add new files into a repository that you have checked-out.
	  Does not actually affect the repository until a "<b>cvs commit</b>" is
	  performed.
	</p>

	<li><b>cvs remove</b> <i>files</i></li>
	<p>
	  Removes files from a checked-out repository. Doesn't affect the repository
	  until a "<b>cvs commit</b>" is performed.
	</p>
	
	<li><b>cvs commit</b> <i>files</i></li>
	<p>
	  This command publishes your changes to other developers by updating
	  the source code in the central repository.
	</p>
      </ul>
    </div>

</div>

<h2>5.12 C/C++ compilation utilities</h2>
 <div class="text">

     <ul>
      <li>
        <b>cc, gcc, CC, g++</li>

<p>UNIX installations usually come with a C and/or C++ compiler.
  The C compiler is usually called <b>cc</b> or <b>gcc</b>, and the C++
  compiler is usually called <b>CC</b> or <b>g++</b>. Most large C or
  C++ programs will come with a <b>makefile</b> and will support the
  <b>configure</b>
  utility, so that compiling and installing a package is often as simple
  as:
<p><b>$ ./configure
<br><b>$ make
<br><b>$ make install
<p>However, there is nothing to prevent you from writing
  and compiling a simple C program yourself:
<p><b>$ cat > hello.c
<br><b>#include &lt;stdio.h>
<br><b>int main() {
<br><b>&nbsp; printf("hello world!\n");
<br><b>&nbsp; return 0;
<br><b>}
<br>(ctrl-d)
<br><b>$ cc hello.c -o hello
<br><b>$ ./hello
<br><b>hello world!
<br><b>$
<p>Here the C compiler (<b>cc</b>) takes as input the C
  source file <b>hello.c</b> and produces as output an executable program
  called
  <b>hello</b>. The program <b>hello</b> may then be executed
  (the <b>./
  </b>tells the shell to look in the current directory to find
  the <b>hello</b> program).</ul>
</blockquote>

</div>

    <h2>5.13 Manual Pages</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li><b>man</b></li>

<p>More information is available on most UNIX commands is
  available via the online manual pages, which are accessible through the
  <b>man</b>
  command. The online documentation is in fact divided into sections. Traditionally,
  they are
<p><b>1 User-level commands
<br><b>2 System calls
<br><b>3 Library functions
<br><b>4 Devices and device drivers
<br><b>5 File formats
<br><b>6 Games
<br><b>7 Various miscellaneous stuff - macro packages etc.
<br><b>8 System maintenance and operation commands
<p>Sometimes <b>man</b> gives you a manual page from the
  wrong section. For example, say you were writing a program and you needed
  to use the <b>rmdir</b> system call. <b>man rmdir</b> gives you the
  manual page for the user-level command <b>rmdir</b>. To force <b>man</b>
  to look in Section 2 of the manual instead, type <b>man 2 rmdir</b> (or<b>man
    -s2 rmdir</b> on some systems).
<p><b>man</b> can also find manual pages which mention
  a particular topic. For example, <b>man -k postscript </b>should produce
  a list of utilities that can produce and manipulate postscript files.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
  <b>info</li>

<p><b>info </b>is an interactive, somewhat more friendly
  and helpful alternative to <b>man</b>. It may not be installed on all
  systems, however.</ul>

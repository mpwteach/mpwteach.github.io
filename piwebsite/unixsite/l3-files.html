      <div class="caption">Fig 3.1: Interpretation of permissions for files
        and directories</div>

      <br>

      <p>
        As we have seen in the previous chapter, every
        file or directory on a UNIX system has three types of permissions, describing
        what operations can be performed on it by various categories of users.
        The permissions are read (<b>r</b>), write (<b>w</b>) and execute (<b>x</b>),
        and the three categories of users are user/owner (<b>u</b>), group (<b>g</b>)
        and others (<b>o</b>). Because files and directories are different entities,
        the interpretation of the permissions assigned to each differs slightly,
        as shown in Fig 3.1.
      </p>
      <p>
        File and directory permissions can only be modified
        by their owners, or by the superuser (<b>root</b>), by using the <b>chmod</b>
        system utility.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><b>chmod</b> (change [file or directory] mode)</li>

        <p class="terminal"> $ chmod <i>options files</i></p>
        
        <p><b>chmod</b> accepts options in two forms. Firstly,
          permissions may be specified as a sequence of 3 octal digits (octal is
          like decimal except that the digit range is 0 to 7 instead of 0 to 9).
          Each octal digit represents the access permissions for the user/owner,
          group and others respectively. The mappings of permissions onto their
          corresponding octal digits is as follows:

          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>---</td>
              <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>--x</td>
              <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-w-</td>
              <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-wx</td>
              <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>r--</td>
              <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>r-x</td>
              <td>5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>rw-</td>
              <td>6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>rwx</td>
              <td>7</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

        <p>For example the command:
          
        <p class="terminal">$ chmod 600 private.txt</p>
        
        <p>sets the permissions on <b>private.txt</b> to <b>rw-------</b>
          (i.e. only the owner can read and write to the file).
        </p>
        <p>Permissions may be specified symbolically, using the symbols
          <b>u</b> (user), <b>g</b> (group), <b>o</b> (other), <b>a</b> (all),
          <b>r</b> (read), <b>w</b> (write), <b>x</b> (execute), <b>+</b> (add permission),
          <b>-</b>(take away permission) and <b>=</b> (assign permission).
        </p>
        <p>For example, the command:</p>
        <p class="terminal"> $ chmod ug=rw,o-rw,a-x *.txt</p>
        
        <p>sets the permissions on all files ending in <b>*.txt</b>
          to <b>rw-rw----</b> (i.e. the owner and users in the file's group can
          read and write to the file, while the general public do not have any sort
          of access).</p>
        <p><b>chmod</b> also supports a <b>-R</b> option which
          can be used to recursively modify file permissions, e.g.</p>
        <p class="terminal"> $ chmod -R go+r play</p>
        <p>will grant group and other read rights to the directory
          <b>play</b>and all of the files and directories within <b>play</b>.</p>
        
        <br>
        <li><b>chgrp</b> (change group)</li>

        <p class="terminal"> $ chgrp <i>group files</i></p>
        <p>can be used to change the group that a file or directory
          belongs to. It also supports a <b>-R</b> option.
      </ul>

    </div>
    
    <h2>3.3 Inspecting File Content</h2>

    <div class="text">

      Besides <b>cat</b> there are several other
      useful utilities for investigating the contents of files:

      <ul>

        <li><b>file</b> <i>filename(s)</i></li>

        <p><b>file </b>analyzes a file's contents for you and reports
          a high-level description of what type of file it appears to be:</p>
        
        <p class="terminal">
          $ file myprog.c letter.txt webpage.html
          <br>myprog.c:     C source, ASCII text
          <br>letter.txt:   ASCII text
          <br>webpage.html: HTML document, ASCII text
        </p>
        
        <p><i>file</i> can identify a wide range of files but sometimes
          gets understandably confused (e.g. when trying to automatically detect
          the difference between C++ and Java code).</p>

        <br><li><b>head, tail</b> <i>filename</i></li>

        <p><b>head</b> and <b>tail</b> display the first and
          last few lines in a file respectively. You can specify the number of lines
          as an option, e.g.
        <p class="terminal">$ tail -20 messages.txt</p>
        <p class="terminal">$ head -5 messages.txt</p>
        
        <p><b>tail </b>includes a useful <b>-f</b> option that
          can be used to continuously monitor the last few lines of a (possibly changing)
          file. This can be used to monitor log files, for example:
          
        <p class="terminal">$ tail -f /var/log/messages</p>

        <p>continuously outputs the latest additions to the system log file.</p>

        <br>
        <li><b>objdump</b> <i>options binaryfile</i></li>

        <p><b>objdump</b> can be used to disassemble binary
          files - that is it can show the machine language instructions which make
          up compiled application programs and system utilities.</p>

        <br>
        <li><b>od</b> <i>options filename</i> (octal dump)</li>

        <p><b>od</b> can be used to displays the contents of
          a binary or text file in a variety of formats, e.g.
        <p class="terminal">
          $ cat hello.txt
          <br>hello world
          <br>$ od -c hello.txt
          <br>0000000&nbsp; h&nbsp; e&nbsp;
          l&nbsp; l&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w&nbsp; o&nbsp; r&nbsp; l&nbsp; d \n
          <br>0000014
          <br>$ od -x hello.txt
          <br>0000000 6865 6c6c 6f20 776f 726c 640a
          <br>0000014
        </p>
      </ul>
      
      <p>There are also several other useful content inspectors that
        are non-standard (in terms of availability on UNIX systems) but are nevertheless
        in widespread use. They are summarised in Fig. 3.2.</p>

    <h2>3.4 Finding Files</h2>

    
    <div class="text">

      <p>There are at least three ways to find files when
        you edon't know their exact location:</p>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li><b>find</b></li>

        <p>If you have a rough idea of the directory tree the file
          might be in (or even if you don't and you're prepared to wait a while)
          you can use <b>find</b>:
          
        <p class="terminal">$ find <i>directory</i> -name <i>targetfile</i> -print</p>
        
        <p><b>find</b> will look for a file called <i>targetfile</i>
          in any part of the directory tree rooted at <i>directory</i>. <i>targetfile</i>
          can include wildcard characters. For example:
        <p class="terminal">$ find /home -name "*.txt" -print 2>/dev/null</p>

        <p>will search all user directories for any file ending in
          <b>.txt</b> and output any matching files (with a full absolute or
          relative path). Here the quotes (<b>"</b>) are necessary to avoid filename
          expansion, while the <b>2>/dev/null </b>suppresses error messages (arising
          from errors such as not being able to read the contents of directories
          for which the user does not have the right permissions).</p>
        <p><b>find</b> can in fact do a lot more than just find
          files by name. It can find files by type (e.g.<b> -type f</b> for files,
          <b>-type d</b> for directories), by permissions (e.g. <b>-perm o=r</b>
          for all files and directories that can be read by others),
          by size (<b>-size</b>) etc. You can also execute commands on the files
          you find. For example,
          
        <p class="terminal">$ find . -name "*.txt" -exec wc -l '{}' ';'</p>

        <p>counts the number of lines in every text file in and below
          the current directory. The <b>'{}' </b>is replaced by the name of each
          file found and the <b>';'</b> ends the <b>-exec</b> clause.</p>
        <p>For more information about <b>find</b> and its abilities,
          use <b>man find</b> and/or <b>info find</b>.</p>
        
        <br>
        <li><b>which</b> (sometimes also called <b>whence</b>) <i>command</i></li>

        <p>If you can execute an application program or system utility
          by typing its name at the shell prompt, you can use <b>which</b> to find
          out where it is stored on disk. For example:</p>
        
        <p class="terminal">$ which ls
          <br>/bin/ls</p>
        
        <br>
        <li><b>locate</b> <i>string</i></li>

        <p><b>find</b> can take a long time to execute if you are
          searching a large filespace (e.g. searching from <b>/</b> downwards).
          The <b>locate</b>command provides a much faster way of locating all
          files whose names match a particular search string. For example:
        <p class="terminal"> $ locate ".txt"</p>
        <p>will find all filenames in the filesystem that contain
          <b>.txt</b> anywhere in their full paths.
        <p>One disadvantage of <b>locate</b> is it stores all filenames
          on the system in an index that is usually updated only once a day. This
          means <b>locate</b> will not find files that have been created very recently.
          It may also report filenames as being present even though the file has
          just been deleted. Unlike <b>find</b>, <b>locate</b> cannot track down
          files on the basis of their permissions, size and so on.

    </div>
    
    <h2>3.5 Finding Text in Files</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <ul>
        
        <li><b>grep</b> (General Regular Expression Print)</li>

        <p class="terminal">$ grep <i>options pattern files</i></p>
        
        <p><b>grep</b> searches the named files (or standard input
          if no files are named) for lines that match a given pattern. The default
          behaviour of <b>grep</b> is to print out the matching lines. For example:
          
        <p class="terminal">$ grep hello *.txt</p>
        
        <p>searches all text files in the current directory for lines
          containing "hello". Some of the more useful options that <b>grep</b>
          provides are:
          <br><b>-c</b> (print a count of the number of lines that
          match), <b>-i</b> (ignore case), <b>-v</b> (print out the lines that
          don't match the pattern) and <b>-n</b> (printout the line number before
          printing the matching line). So
          
        <p class="terminal">$ grep -vi hello *.txt</p>
        
        <p>searches all text files in the current directory for lines
          that do not contain any form of the word hello (e.g. Hello, HELLO, or hELlO).
        <p>If you want to search all files in an entire directory
          tree for a particular pattern, you can combine <b>grep</b> with <b>find
          </b>using backward single quotes to pass the output from <b>find</b> into <b>grep</b>.
          So
          
        <p class="terminal">$ grep hello `find . -name "*.txt" -print`</p>
        
        <p>will search all text files in the directory tree rooted
          at the current directory for lines containing the word "hello".
        <p>The patterns that <b>grep</b> uses are actually a special
          type of pattern known as <b>regular expressions</b>.
          Just like arithemetic expressions, regular expressions are made up of basic
          subexpressions combined by operators.
        <p>The most fundamental expression is a regular expression
          that matches a single character. Most characters, including all letters
          and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves. Any other
          character with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash
          (<b>\</b>). A list of characters enclosed by '<b>[</b>' and '<b>]</b>'
          matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the
          list is the caret `<b>^</b>', then it matches any character not in the
          list. A range of characters can be specified using a dash (<b>-</b>)
          between the first and last items in the list. So <b>[0-9]</b> matches
          any digit and <b>[^a-z]</b> matches any character that is not a letter.
        <p>The caret `<b>^</b>' and the dollar sign `<b>$</b>'
          are special characters that
          <br>match the beginning and end of a line respectively. The
          dot '<b>.</b>' matches any character. So
          
        <p class="terminal"> $ grep ^..[l-z]$ hello.txt</p>

        <p>matches any line in <b>hello.txt</b> that contains a
          three character sequence that ends with a lowercase letter from l to z.
        <p><b>egrep</b> (extended grep) is a variant of grep that
          supports more sophisticated regular expressions. Here two regular expressions
          may be joined by the operator `<b>|</b>'; the resulting regular expression
          matches any string matching either subexpression. Brackets '<b>(</b>'
          and '<b>)</b>' may be used for grouping regular expressions. In addition,
          a regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:

          <ul>
            <li><b>`?'</b> means the preceding item is optional (matched at most once).</li>
            <li><b>`*'&nbsp;</b> means the preceding item will be matched zero or more times.</li>
            <li><b>`+'</b> means the preceding item will be matched one or more times.</li>
            <li><b>`{N}'&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> means the preceding item is matched exactly N times.</li>
            <li><b>`{N,}'&nbsp;</b> means the preceding item is matched N or more times.</li>
            <li><b>`{N,M}'</b> means the preceding item is matched</li>
            at least N times, but not more than M times.
          </ul>
          
        <p>For example, if <b>egrep</b> was given the regular expression
        <p><b>'(^[0-9]{1,5}[a-zA-Z ]+$)|none'</b></p>
        <p>it would match any line that either:
          <ul>
            <li>begins with a number up to five digits long, followed by
              a sequence of one or more letters or spaces, or</li>

            <li>contains the word <b>none</b></li>
          </ul>
          
        <p>You can read more about regular expressions on the <b>grep</b> and <b>egrep</b>
          manual pages.</p>
        <p>Note that UNIX systems also usually support another <b>grep</b>
          variant called <b>fgrep</b> (fixed grep) which simply looks for a fixed
          string inside a file (but this facility is largely redundant).

    <h2>3.6 Sorting files</h2>

    <div class="text">
      
      <p>There are two facilities that are useful for sorting files in UNIX:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>sort</b> <i>filenames</i></li>

        <p><b>sort</b> sorts lines contained in a group of files
          alphabetically (or if the <b>-n</b> option is specified) numerically.
          The sorted output is displayed on the screen, and may be stored in another
          file by redirecting the output. So
          
        <p class="terminal"> $ sort input1.txt input2.txt > output.txt</p>
        
        <p>outputs the sorted concentenation of files <b>input1.txt</b>
          and <b>input2.txt</b> to the file <b>output.txt</b>.</p>
        <br>

        <li><b>uniq</b> <i>filename</i></li>

        <p><b>uniq</b> removes duplicate adjacent lines from a
          file. This facility is most useful when combined with <b>sort</b>:
          
        <p class="terminal">$ sort input.txt | uniq > output.txt</p>

    </div>


    <h2>3.7 File Compression and Backup</h2>

    <div class="text">

      <p>UNIX systems usually support a number of utilities
        for backing up and compressing files. The most useful are:</p>

      <ul>
        
        <li><b>tar</b> (tape archiver)</li>

        <p><b>tar</b> backs up entire directories and files onto
          a tape device or (more commonly) into a single disk file known as an archive.
          An archive is a file that contains other files plus information about them,
          such as their filename, owner, timestamps, and access permissions.
          <b>tar</b> does not perform any compression by default.
        <p>To create a disk file <b>tar</b> archive, use
          
        <p class="terminal">$ tar -cvf <i>archivenamefilenames</i></p>
        <p>where <i>archivename</i> will usually have a <b>.tar</b>
          extension. Here the <b>c</b> option means create, <b>v</b> means verbose
          (output filenames as they are archived), and <b>f</b> means file.To list
          the contents of a <b>tar</b> archive, use
          
        <p class="terminal">$ tar -tvf <i>archivename</i></p>
        
        <p>To restore files from a <b>tar</b> archive, use</p>

        <p class="terminal">$ tar -xvf <i>archivename</i></p>

        <li><b>cpio</b></li>

        <p><b>cpio </b>is another facility for creating and reading
          archives. Unlike <b>tar</b>, <b>cpio</b> doesn't automatically archive
          the contents of directories, so it's common to combine <b>cpio</b> with
          <b>find</b> when creating an archive:
          
        <p class="terminal">$ find . -print -depth | cpio -ov -Htar > <i>archivename</i></p>

        <p>This will take all the files in the current directory and the
          directories below and place them in an archive called
          <i>archivename</i>.The <b>-depth</b> option controls the order in which the
          filenames are produced and is recommended
          to prevent problems with directory permissions when doing a restore.The
          <b>-o</b> option creates the archive, the <b>-v</b> option prints the names of
          the files archived as they are added and the <b>-H</b> option specifies
          an archive format type (in this case it creates a <b>tar</b> archive).
          Another common archive type is <b>crc</b>, a portable format with a checksum
          for error control.
          
        <p>To list the contents of a <b>cpio</b> archive, use
          
        <p class="terminal">$ cpio -tv &lt; <i>archivename</i></p>

        <p>To restore files, use:</p>
        
        <p class="terminal">$ cpio -idv &lt; <i>archivename</i></p>
        
        <p>Here the <b>-d</b> option will create directories as
          necessary. To force <b>cpio</b> to extract files on top of files
          of the same name that already exist (and have the same or later modification
          time), use the <b>-u</b> option.</p>

        <li><b>compress</b>, <b>gzip</b></li>

        <p><b>compress</b> and <b>gzip</b> are utilities for
          compressing and decompressing individual files (which may be or may not
          be archive files). To compress files, use:

        <p class="terminal">$ compress <i>filename</i></p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p class="terminal">$ gzip <i>filename</i></p>
        
        <p>In each case, <i>filename</i> will be deleted and replaced
          by a compressed file called <i>filename</i>.Z or <i>filename</i>.gz. To
          reverse the compression process, use:</p>
        
        <p class="terminal">$ compress -d <i>filename</i></p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p class="terminal">$ gzip -d <i>filename</i></p>
      </ul>

    <h2>3.8 Handling Removable Media (e.g. floppy disks)</h2>


    <div class="text">

      <p>UNIX supports tools for accessing removable media
	such as CDROMs and floppy disks.</p>

      <ul>
        
        <li><b>mount, umount</b></li>

        <p>The <b>mount</b> command serves to attach the filesystem
          found on some device to the filesystem tree. Conversely, the <b>umount</b>
          command will detach it again (it is very important to remember to do this
          when removing the floppy or CDROM). The file <b>/etc/fstab</b> contains
          a list of devices and the points at which they will be attached to the
          main filesystem:</p>

        <p class="terminal">$ cat /etc/fstab
          <br>/dev/fd0&nbsp;&nbsp; /mnt/floppy&nbsp; auto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          rw,user,noauto&nbsp; 0 0
          <br>/dev/hdc&nbsp;&nbsp; /mnt/cdrom&nbsp;&nbsp; iso9660
          ro,user,noauto&nbsp; 0 0</p>

        <p>In this case, the mount point for the floppy drive is
          <b>/mnt/floppy</b>
          and the mount point for the CDROM is <b>/mnt/cdrom</b>. To access a floppy
          we can use:
          
        <p class="terminal">$ mount /mnt/floppy
          <br>$ cd /mnt/floppy
          <br>$ ls (etc...)</p>

        <p>To force all changed data to be written back to the floppy
          and to detach the floppy disk from the filesystem, we use:
        <p class="terminal">$ umount /mnt/floppy</p>
        
        <li><b>mtools</b></li>
        
        <p>If they are installed, the (non-standard) <b>mtools</b>
          utilities provide a convenient way of accessing DOS-formatted floppies
          without having to mount and unmount filesystems. You can use DOS-type commands
          like "<b>mdir a:</b>", "<b>mcopy a:*.* .</b>", "<b>mformat a:</b>",
          etc. (see the
          <b>mtools </b>manual pages for more details).
